// Eight takes on a stylized lowercase cursive f, rendered at 512/128/64/32/16.
//
// A cursive f is a lucky letterform for this brand: it is already a curl, it is
// already one continuous thread, and it is already the first letter of the name.
// What it is not is favicon-friendly — a written f wants two loops, a crossbar
// and thin hairlines, and the 16px budget affords roughly one of the three.

    small: "Holds. Both hooks are open rather than closed, so there is no counter that can seal — the failure mode of every other f here.",
    risk: "Without the crossbar some people will read it as an integral or a long s rather than an f. That ambiguity is the price of the legibility.",

    risk: "Three horizontal bands (hook, crossbar, hook) inside 320 units is the tightest arrangement in either sheet. There is no room left to adjust anything.",

    // The deep hook of the Integral drops its right-hand limb to y=240, exactly
    // where a crossbar has to sit. Trimming both hooks lifts that limb to y=142
