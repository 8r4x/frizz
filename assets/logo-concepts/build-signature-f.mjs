// The written cursive f: ONE contiguous stroke with exactly two free ends, and
// exactly 180-degree rotationally symmetric.
//
// The reference sketch has two loose ends and nothing else. Reading it as a
// closed figure-eight with a crossbar laid across it — which is what an earlier
// draft did — gets the topology wrong, and the result reads as an 8 with a line
// through it because that is literally what it is. The real path is:
//
//   left tail -> UP into the ascender -> apex -> down across the middle
//             -> round the descender -> out to the right tail
//
// The direction matters as much as the topology. Entering from the left the
// stroke must rise up-and-RIGHT into the ascender, so the first thing it does is
// swoop up. Running the loop the other way round hides that rise inside the
// crossing and the letter reads as swooping down first.
//
// The apparent "crossbar" is not a stroke at all. It is the long entry and exit
// diagonals, which leave the letter on opposite sides at mirrored heights and so
// line up into what looks like one bar crossing the middle.
//
// C2 then falls out of the same fact that makes the letter work: the descender
// half IS the ascender half rotated. So only one half is authored — from the
// centre of symmetry out to one tail tip — and c2() derives the rest. Nothing
// is drawn twice, so nothing can be slightly off.

 * tail tip. c2() supplies the descender half and the right tail.

 * The centre is the point the whole path maps onto itself through, and it sits

 * difference between a flowing written letter and a mathematical figure-eight.
 *
 * `loop` widens the ascender about its own axis without stretching the tails, so
