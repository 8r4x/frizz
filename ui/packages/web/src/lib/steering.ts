// OPTIMISTIC STEER STATE — "your message is in, this thread is working again", rendered the instant
// the operator commits rather than when the server can prove it.
//
// Why this needs to exist at all: delivering a follow-up is a synchronous tmux injection that takes
// ~250–800ms of subprocess work, and the thread only reads as RUNNING once the tailer subsequently
// observes the worker's turn start in the JSONL — seconds later, on a poll fray does not control. In
// between, every board-driven surface still renders the thread exactly as it was: at rest, or worse,
// still wearing its "needs your input" mark for an ask the human just answered. The steer looks lost.
//
// The optimistic record closes that window. It is NOT a second source of truth: it is a short-lived
// hint that only ever fires while server truth has said nothing new, and it yields the moment the
// server has anything at all to say.
