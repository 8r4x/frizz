// A DETACHED DAEMON is a module fray spawns as its own `node <file>` process. Unlike every other
// module in this workspace it must therefore EXIST AS A REAL FILE at runtime — being reachable
// through an `import` is not enough.
//
// That is the trap this module exists to close. A promoted fray artifact is ONE esbuild bundle
// (`<artifact>/runtime/src/index.js`), so a daemon referenced the obvious way —
// `new URL("./thing-daemon.ts", import.meta.url)` — resolves to a sibling path the bundle never
// emitted. `spawn()` still succeeds; node then exits MODULE_NOT_FOUND, and the caller reports the
// generic "daemon exited before it became ready". Nothing in dev catches it, because in a source
// checkout the `.ts` really is on disk.
//
// Live incident 2026-07-23: the Codex app-server moved into a detached daemon at 10:34, the artifact
// was promoted at 12:16, and every Codex dispatch, follow-up, steer and interrupt failed until this
// was found. Three layers now make that unrepeatable:
//   1. artifacts.ts bundles every entry below beside index.js,
//   2. artifacts.ts then ASSERTS each one landed — a build that would ship a missing daemon fails,
//   3. resolveDetachedDaemonEntry() checks the file exists and names what it looked for if not.
