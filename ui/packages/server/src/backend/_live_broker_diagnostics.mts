// LIVE proof that a REALLY-FORKED broker daemon writes its own death forensics to disk:
//   nub packages/server/src/backend/_live_broker_diagnostics.mts
//
// claude-broker-diagnostics.test.ts proves the writer. This proves the DAEMON is actually handed the
// path and uses it — the seam that was silently missing before (onDiagnostic was plumbed all the way
// through claude-broker-client.ts and the bridge never supplied a handler).
//
// The load-bearing assertion is the third one. `lifecycle:started` is emitted while the SDK query
// spins up, which is BEFORE the daemon's socket is listening and long before fray can attach — so the
// socket relay is structurally incapable of carrying it, and the `if (client) write(...)` the daemon
// used to do meant it went nowhere at all. Only a write from inside the daemon catches it.
