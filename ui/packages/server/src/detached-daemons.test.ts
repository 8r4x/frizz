// artifact that ships to users, and silent until a spawned process dies with MODULE_NOT_FOUND.
// codex-app-server-host.ts did exactly this and took every Codex turn down (2026-07-23).
//
// Anything that must exist as a real file at runtime belongs in DETACHED_DAEMON_ENTRIES, which the
// artifact build emits and then asserts. So the pattern itself is banned in shipped server/CLI code:
// reintroducing it fails here, naming the file, instead of on a user's machine a build later.
