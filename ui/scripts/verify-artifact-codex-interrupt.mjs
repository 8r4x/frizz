// END-TO-END proof that STOPPING a Codex thread actually stops the Codex turn.
//
// The bug this guards against: an app-server Codex thread has NO tmux pane, so every "stop this
// thread" verb went through the tmux terminator — kill-session for a session that never existed,
// reported as "stopped", while the turn kept running. That was masked while the app-server died with
// the fray runtime. It no longer does: the app-server lives in a DETACHED daemon that deliberately
// outlives us (see verify-artifact-restart-survival.mjs), so a turn fray claims to have stopped keeps
// burning tokens and touching the repo with no fray-side owner and no UI trace.
//
// A unit test with a mocked bridge cannot prove a turn stopped. This drives the REAL thing: a built
// artifact, a real codex worker running `sleep 60`, killed over the real RPC surface, and the CODEX
// ROLLOUT ITSELF as ground truth — `turn_aborted` (the turn was interrupted) must appear and
// `task_complete` (the turn ran to its own ending) must NOT.
//
// Isolation: temp HOME + state dir + project dir, unique port and tmux socket, wakers/reaper off.
// CODEX_HOME points at the real ~/.codex so the app-server can authenticate; nothing is written there
// beyond the throwaway rollouts codex records for itself.
