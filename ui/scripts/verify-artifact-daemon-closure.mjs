// END-TO-END proof that a PROMOTED ARTIFACT can actually run Codex.
//
// The failure this guards against lives ONLY in a built artifact: the runtime is a single esbuild
// bundle, so a detached daemon referenced as a sibling `.ts` resolves to a path that was never
// emitted — node exits MODULE_NOT_FOUND and every Codex dispatch/follow-up/steer fails with
// "codex app-server daemon exited before it became ready" (live outage 2026-07-23). A source-run
// stack cannot see it either way, so this builds a REAL artifact and drives the REAL app from it.
//
// Isolation: temp HOME + state dir, unique port and tmux socket, wakers and reaper off. CODEX_HOME
// points at the real ~/.codex so the app-server can authenticate; nothing is written there beyond the
// throwaway rollout codex records for itself.
