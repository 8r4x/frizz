// Browser QA for the SETTLED NATIVE ASK: an AskUserQuestion the operator steered past (or answered)
// must keep rendering in the transcript as a read-only question card, through the REAL path — Message →
// parts walk → ToolCardRouter → SettledAskBlock. States on this page:
//   1. WITHDRAWN, unanswered — dim chips + the "Not answered" note.
//   2. ANSWERED single-select — the recorded choice in the quiet settled treatment.
//   3. ANSWERED multi-select — two settled checks.
//   4. ANSWERED with free text that names no option — the recessed answer row.
//   5. PENDING (negative control) — folds into the ordinary "Ran N tool calls" disclosure.
//
// `?font=sans|mono` sets `data-font`. The prose font is a user setting applied before first paint, and a
// fixture that does not set it silently renders the mono default.
