// Browser QA for the render-error boundaries. The thing being proved is a NEGATIVE — that a throwing
// component no longer blanks the window — so the fixture has to actually throw, in the actual shape
// that took frizz down: a FREE IDENTIFIER left in the bundle by an artifact built from a torn working
// tree (ChatView.tsx's unqueue hooks were called one edit before their `import` line was written, and
// a free identifier is legal JS, so rolldown emitted the calls without a word).
//
// `declare const` reproduces that exactly: TypeScript is satisfied, the declaration erases at build,
// and the emitted call references a name that was never defined — the identical ReferenceError, from
// the identical mechanism, rather than a hand-rolled `throw new Error("boom")` that proves less.
