// DEV-ONLY render instrumentation, opt-in via `?scan=1`.
//
// NOTHING IN THE APP IMPORTS THIS FILE. It is loaded as its own `<script type="module">`, injected
// into the head ahead of main.tsx by the `frizz:dev-render-scan` Vite plugin, which is `apply:
// "serve"` — so this module and everything it drags in (react-scan, react-grab, preact, bippy:
// 185,755 bytes of entry chunk, measured 2026-09-04) exist in dev and are absent from the production
// graph by construction rather than by tree-shaking. main.tsx imported it until 2026-09-04 and
// shipped all of that to every user, because the `import.meta.env.DEV` guard below sits inside the
// function while the import sat at the top.
//
// It is a separate script rather than a lazy import because react-scan side-effect-imports bippy,
// which installs `__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__`, and react-dom reads that global once at its own
// module scope. `await import("react-scan")` therefore always loses the race — see the long note on
// the plugin in vite.config.ts.
//
// It answers one question we otherwise can only guess at: when opening a thread drawer, WHICH
// components render, how many times, and how much of that was avoidable? Results land on
// `window.__frizzScan` for a CDP routine to read back.
