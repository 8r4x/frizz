// exited thread opened with a Retry pill while its rail row showed the muted [✓] (maintainer
// 2026-07-23: "threads that appear to just have come to rest, but they have a retry button and they are
// not yellow. They don't have an exclamation point"). It now gates on `offersRetry` — the ONE shared
// derivation for the verb across every surface (stalled rows AND auto-resume usage-limit-held rows).
