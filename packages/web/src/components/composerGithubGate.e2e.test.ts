// REGRESSION. GithubTrigger self-gates (renders null when gh is unauthed), but Composer reserves the
// leftAction rail slot whenever the PROP is truthy — and a `<GithubTrigger />` element is truthy even
// when it renders nothing. Passing it unconditionally left an empty hole between the paperclip and
// send. The fix hoists the gate to the caller via useGithubTriggerVisible(): unauthed → no leftAction
// prop → the paperclip sits directly beside send. These tests pin both states off the
// composer-icons fixture, whose `?unauthed` query stubs the signed-out githubStatus.
//
// Skipped unless a Vite URL serving the fixtures is provided (same pattern as the other *.e2e.test.ts
// here): start `vite` in packages/web and set FRIZZ_COMPOSER_ICONS_E2E_URL to its origin.

// REGRESSION (2026-08-11). The network to api.github.com dropped for nine minutes. `gh repo view` is a
// live API call, so the server answered inRepo:false, the trigger vanished — and it STAYED vanished in an
// open tab long after the network came back, because nothing re-asks a question already answered.
// useGithubStatus now polls while the answer is NO and stops at the first yes. This drives the real
// thing: a real browser, a real react-query interval, a real wall-clock minute. No reload.

// `refetchInterval` is 60s while the answer is NO, and react-query starts that timer only once the
// first query settles — so the icon returns at 60s PLUS page load, plus the fetch, plus whatever the
// machine is doing. A 90s ceiling leaves 30s of headroom for all of that, and it is not enough: this
// test passed at 60s in one run and timed out at 91s in the next, on the same code (2026-08-24).
//
// A bigger ceiling costs nothing when the test passes, because the wait EXITS on the icon appearing —
// the usual run is still ~62s. What it buys is that a failure here means the icon never came back,
// which is the claim, rather than that the machine was busy. The CONTROL below keeps the 90s window,
