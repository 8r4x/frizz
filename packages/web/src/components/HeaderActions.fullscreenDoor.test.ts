// THE FULLSCREEN DOOR IS ONE SLOT, BOTH DIRECTIONS.
//
// The queue card's action strip carries the door OPENING (ExpandThreadLink, ⤢) and the /full page's
// header carries it CLOSING (CollapseThreadLink, ⤡) — and the whole point is that they stand in the
// SAME position in the same strip, so the icon that took the reader out of the queue is the icon that
// brings them back (maintainer 2026-09-02: "instead of a back arrow in the upper left, I think we
// should just have a collapse icon in the same place where the expand icon is in the cue card").
//
// Before that, /full's way out was an ArrowLeft sitting BEFORE THE TITLE, at the header's far left:
// a second, unrelated place to look for a whole-thread verb, and a "previous page" glyph on a control
// whose job is to change how this thread is SHOWN. So what is pinned here is the POSITION, not merely
// the presence of an icon — a future edit that keeps both halves but drifts one of them out of the
// slot loses the entire behaviour the request asked for.

// STALLED, so the strip's far-right verb (Retry) is on the other side of the door. Most of the strip
// gates itself away in a bare render — Reload plugins and Restart worker want a dev build and a live
// broker process, and both simply return null here — so a harness that does not deliberately put
// NEIGHBOURS on both sides of the door cannot tell a position apart from a presence. (It did not:
// moving the closing half to the head of the strip left every reading identical, and the first version
// of the slot test below passed the control that was meant to break it.)
