// THE shared rounded-rect checkbox geometry — the ONE outer shape every rail status glyph sits in, and
// the shape the in-progress spinner traces. Lives in its own module because BOTH the sidebar's
// top-level row indicator and the indented child-operation row (ChildOpRow, "rail" density) draw it;
// keeping it in Sidebar.tsx would make the child row import its own parent.

// [/] IN PROGRESS — the rounded-RECT spinner: a faint full outline with a bright segment travelling the
// perimeter (matches the checkbox shape instead of a circle — maintainer 2026-07-10). `size` lets the
// indented sub-agent rows use a smaller one so the two spinners stay the same SHAPE at different scales.
//
// SINCE 2026-09-20 THE SPINNER IS THE FRAME FOR EVERY "SOMETHING WILL WAKE THIS" ROW, and `children` is
// the mark inside it that says WHAT (maintainer 2026-09-19: "everything in the running rail should
// always have this spinner animation going"). Empty = this thread's own turn is running. The rail puts
// a solid blue dot inside for a rest on a live background shell, the ellipsis for a parent that has
// rested while its sub-agents are still out, and GitHub's octocat for a PR whose checks are running —
// the same glyphs the static StatusBox draws for the settled version of each state, so a row keeps its
// mark and only gains or loses the motion around it. The mark is centred over the SVG rather than drawn
// into it so it can be any element, including the CSS-sized `.frizz-rail-dot`.
export function BoxSpinner({ size = STATUS_BOX, children }: { size?: number; children?: ReactNode }) {
  // Geometry MUST match StatusBox exactly (maintainer 2026-07-10: the spinner read "slightly smaller
  // and bolder"). StatusBox is a 15px border-box with a 1px border and rounded-[4px] corners, so the
  // border's outer edge sits at 0/15. To replicate that with a center-drawn SVG stroke: strokeWidth 1,
  // inset the path by 0.5 (x=0.5, w=14) so the stroke's outer edge lands on the box edge, and rx=3.5
  // (4px outer radius minus the 0.5 half-stroke). Perimeter of that rounded rect ≈ 50, so the dash sum
  // stays 50. The faint base outline is toned to the checkbox's border-muted/45 weight.
