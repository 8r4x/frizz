// WHERE THE FULLSCREEN MORPH STARTS: what the reader can SEE of the surface, not the whole of it.
//
// The door's view transition names the queue card (or drawer panel) `thread-chat` and lets the browser
// morph it into the /full thread column. The browser's own group animation runs from the OLD element's
// full border box to the new one's — which for a card that fits on screen is exactly right, and for a
// tall card scrolled to its middle is a disaster. Measured on a 24-turn card, 2869px tall, parked
// halfway down (maintainer 2026-09-12: "full screen animation is not smooth when scrolled to the
// middle of a tall card"): the group's keyframes ran from `translate(629px, -1020px) 720×2869` to
// `translate(190px, 0) 720×900`, so every pixel the reader had in front of them rushed 1020px DOWN
// the screen in 200ms while the new column cross-faded in over it — the card's sticky header, which
// had been 1020px above the viewport, swept through mid-screen at the 40ms frame. The scroll hand-off
// (fullscreenHandoff.ts) had put the same message at the same height on the other side, so the CONTENT
// was continuous and the ANIMATION was the only thing moving it.
//
// The fix keeps the browser's morph and changes only its starting box: the door measures the part of
// the surface inside the viewport and hands it to the group's `from` keyframe through custom
// properties (`--frizz-vt-from-*`), gated by `data-vt-door` on the root so the reverse leg — whose old
// element is the /full column, always fully on screen — keeps the browser's own keyframes. The old
// snapshot is still the whole card; a negative top margin slides the reader's part up to the group's
// top edge. That margin is a PERCENTAGE of the group's width rather than a pixel count on purpose: the
// snapshot is `inline-size: 100%; block-size: auto`, so it scales with the group as the card's width
// morphs into the column's, and a percentage of the same width is the one unit that scales with it.
//
// Mid-card, top and bottom both off screen, the morph is now a horizontal slide of what the reader
// was looking at into the column's position, cross-fading onto the same text — measured after: from
// `translate(629px, 0) 720×900` to `translate(190px, 0) 720×900`. A card whose top is on screen
// still starts from that top edge, exactly as before: nothing is clipped that was visible.
