// WHICH PROJECT THIS PAGE IS SHOWING, taken from its own URL.
//
// One Frizz per machine serves every project from one origin, so the URL names the project:
// `/project/nub/thread/fix-auth`. That works precisely because Frizz's own routes were moved under
// `/_frizz/` — the top-level namespace is otherwise free, so a first segment is either the SPA's own
// route or the `project` segment, and nothing else. (`/nub/thread/x` — the project at the ROOT — was
// the shape considered and rejected; see PROJECT_SEGMENT below for why it cost too much.)
//
// AN EMPTY BASE IS A SUPPORTED STATE, not a bug: the launching project is still served unprefixed at
// `/thread/<slug>` and `/status/<name>`, which is what lets the server land slug routing without a
// lockstep rewrite of this file, and what keeps every pre-singleton bookmark resolving. It is a legacy
// INBOUND alias, not a shape to MINT — see `outerPath`/`projectHref`. Note it does NOT include `/`,
// which is the all-projects GRID; the launching project's queue reaches its board through
// `queueDestination` (lib/router.ts) instead.
