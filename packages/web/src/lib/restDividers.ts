// WHEN THE "Agent rested" HAIRLINE SAYS NOTHING THE READER CANNOT ALREADY SEE.
//
// The rule survives because of the one case where the transcript really is ambiguous: a human message
// under an agent's prose can be a REPLY to a finished agent or a STEER typed into a turn still in
// flight, and without the rule those two read identically. Measured over this repo's own 30 Claude
// sessions: 84 human bubbles, 40 of them after a rest and 11 typed mid-turn, so the rule is genuinely
// discriminating there and not a constant. The other two positions it lands in are not:
//
//   · AT THE TAIL, it restates the runtime-status slot directly beneath it. A running turn draws the
//     WorkingIndicator there; a rested one draws nothing (or the awaiting-background card). "The agent
//     is not spinning" is therefore already on screen, and the hairline is a second copy of it.
//   · ABOVE ANOTHER DIVIDER, it restates the divider. Nothing can WAKE an agent that had not come to
//     rest, so "Agent rested" / "Frizz asked for a sign-off" is one fact drawn twice — two hairlines
//     stacked with nothing between them (maintainer 2026-08-13: "we're just getting these back-to-back
//     hairlines that are kind of unnecessary").
//
// A frizz wake DELIVERY counts as a divider even though it is a `role: "user"` record: `wake: true`
// messages render as a FrizzWake or a RecurringPromptLine, never as a plain bubble, so they
// carry the seam themselves. The human's own messages are the only `user` records that do not.
//
// This is presentation, not projection — the server still emits every rest boundary. Dropping them
// server-side would mean a trailing rest that vanishes and then reappears the moment a human replies,
// i.e. a mid-array insertion the live transcript push has no reason to handle.
