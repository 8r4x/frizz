// ONE QUESTION, ONE CARD — folding a ```question fence into the registered question it restates.
//
// A worker can ask the same question twice at one rest: register it with `ask` (a row, the durable
// form) and then, at sign-off, write it again as a ```question fence because the contract says the
// fence is the handback. Both producers reach QuestionBlockCard, so the transcript drew the question
// twice, back to back, on the thread page and the queue card (maintainer 2026-08-28: "Same question
// showing up twice in a row" — a release go/no-go registered at 10:11 and re-fenced at 10:11 with
// "(also on the board as a card)" appended, after two PR-watcher wakes had buried the first fence).
//
// The REGISTERED card is the one that survives, and it is not a coin toss: answering it settles the
// row, which is what un-gates `done` and dequeues the thread; answering the fence sends a plain
// follow-up and leaves the row open behind it, so the worker wakes to an answer it cannot `done` past.
// (lib/registeredDone.ts folds the other way — a fenced done beside a registered one keeps the message's
// card — because there the two are the same bytes and nothing is settled by which one is drawn.)
//
// A fence is folded only when it demonstrably RESTATES a registration standing at the SAME REST. A
// different question fenced beside a registered one still renders — the fold never hides a question
// the human has not seen elsewhere on the page. The text rule is deliberately loose about markup (the
// fence wraps `code` and [links](…) that the registration's plain string cannot carry) and about
// trailing prose (the worker appends a parenthetical), and strict about the question itself.
