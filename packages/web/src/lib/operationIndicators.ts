// THE DOT MEANS "A SHELL IS ALIVE RIGHT NOW" — not "a shell was detached".
//
// It briefly meant the narrower thing. The dot was worn by any pending call, so an ordinary Bash that
// was simply taking a while read as a detached job; that was corrected (2026-07-29) by reserving the dot
// for `run_in_background` and giving a pending foreground call a neutral spinner instead. The spinner is
// what did not survive contact: once the mark moved to the head of the row, a long-running foreground
// command was the ONE live thing on screen with no mark in the liveness column, announcing itself
// through a small grey ring at the far edge instead (maintainer 2026-07-30: "we should use the blue dot
// even for non-backgrounded bash scripts that are running for more than like a second or two … instead
// of the spinner").
//
// So detachment is no longer what the hue encodes — RUNTIME KIND is: blue for a shell, accent-yellow for
// a sub-agent, whichever way the shell was launched. What detachment still decides is the reading beside
// the dot ("running" vs "background running" in the tooltip) and, for a tracked op, whether fray can
// observe it going quiet at all.
//
// `run_in_background` is read straight off the tool input at parse time (transcript.ts — Bash
// `run_in_background: true`, and Monitor, which is always detached), so a detached op is known
// definitively and marks itself the instant it starts: fray has a real process to point at.
