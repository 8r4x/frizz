// THE recovery follow-up, shared by every surface that offers to restart an exited session — the
// thread header's Retry pill, the queue card header's, and the sidebar row's hover-revealed one — so
// they can never send different messages down different paths.
//
// Recovery is an ORDINARY follow-up: the server reattaches the dead provider session (for a detached
// Codex app-server session it rebinds the rollout and retires the phantom current turn first), then
// starts this continuation. That sentence was already true of the MESSAGE and false of everything
// else: this called rpc.followUp DIRECTLY, so alone among the send paths it skipped the optimistic
// bubble, the steer hint, and the per-slug FIFO chain. Measured cost — the row kept its yellow [!] and
// its rested-band position for 2.2s after the click, with a toast as the only sign the click landed,
// on the one verb whose whole job is rescuing a thread that already looks broken. Being off the FIFO
// chain was the quieter half: a Retry racing a composer send can lose the server's runtime-control CAS
// and fail outright.
//
// So recovery goes through sendEagerFollowUp like every other send, and is now an ordinary follow-up
// in the CODE as well as in the prose. The session guard it used to resolve by hand comes with it —
// sendEagerFollowUp binds the id at send time from the live board, which is strictly better than the
// render-time read this did.
