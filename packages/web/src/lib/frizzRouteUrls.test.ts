// Everything Frizz serves lives under `/_frizz/` (c34a7e2), and a page addresses its OWN project via
// apiBase() — so a client URL built as a bare `/local-image?…` reaches the SPA shell instead of the
// route, gets HTML back, and the <img> fires onError. That is invisible in review and invisible in
// the type system: it presents as an attachment thumbnail that silently degrades to a file tile and a
// chat screenshot that degrades to grey path text, which is exactly how it shipped and how it was
// found. The prefix sweep already missed markdownTargets once; it then missed BlockImage, the composer
// chip, the Codex template preview and the visualization iframe. This is the pin that ends that class.
//
// It scans SOURCE, not behavior, because there is nowhere else the whole set is visible at once.
