// The one clipboard write behind every copy affordance in the app. `navigator.clipboard` exists only
// in a SECURE context — https, or localhost — and Frizz is routinely read from neither: `--host`
// serves the board over plain http to a LAN address, which is exactly the origin a phone is reading.
// There the async API is simply undefined, and every surface that checked for it and gave up ("copy
// the command from a secure Frizz page") was refusing the copy on the page the user actually had. The
// fallback is the classic one — select the text in an off-screen textarea and `execCommand("copy")` —
// which every engine still ships and which needs only the user activation the click already provides.
//
// The fallback also runs when `writeText` REJECTS (a focus/activation blip, a denied permission): the
// textarea path may still land the copy, and when it does the user never needs to hear about it.
