// Parse an assistant message's markdown for ```done / ```awaiting SIGNAL fences so the renderer can
// set each one off as a CARD in place of the raw block (mirrors questionBlocks.ts). Transcripts arrive
// as raw markdown, so the client parses fences itself — the grammar is identical to the fence spec the
// worker writes and the server's lastFence parser: an opening line exactly ```done or ```awaiting, the
// body, then a closing ``` line. Pure string logic, no DOM — unit-testable.
//
// The signal fence LANGUAGE is the state: `done` = a presentation-only success card (thread lifecycle
// actions live in a stable footer), `awaiting` = a compact parked human/timer handoff. Distinct
// from ```question blocks (their own machinery in questionBlocks.ts) — those never match here.

// state), a newline, then the body non-greedily to the next line that is exactly ``` (optional trailing
// spaces). The `m` flag anchors ^/$ to line boundaries; an unterminated opener never matches, so a
// half-written fence degrades to ordinary prose (markdown renders it as a plain code block). ```question
// can't match the (done|awaiting) alternation, so question blocks are left entirely to questionBlocks.ts.

// Split the body of a fence into its prose (hint lines removed) and its parsed hints. `done` fences
// carry no hints — the whole body is prose.
//
// ONE PARSER, IN @frizz/shared, AND THIS IS WHY. This file used to carry its own copy of the grammar with
// a comment on it saying "THIS LIST MUST MATCH THE TAILER'S … keep them in step". The 2026-08-24 YAML
// cutover moved the tailer and not this, so a correct current-grammar fence parked correctly on the
// server and rendered `shells: [bzvtnt3ig]` as PROSE in the in-chat card — the raw frontmatter printed at
// the human, which is the exact bug class that comment was written to prevent. A comment cannot keep two
// implementations in step; having one implementation can.
//
// THIS CALL IS WHY THE `yaml` PACKAGE IS IN THE ENTRY CHUNK, and it is not the barrel's doing.
// Measured 2026-09-04 by building three ways: yaml stubbed out costs 97,450 bytes of the entry chunk;
// with this one call removed and the barrel's `import … from "yaml"` left exactly as it is, rolldown
// tree-shakes 66,095 of those away by itself. So a perf pass that moves the export out of @frizz/shared
// into its own module buys nothing while ChatView, RestedCard and registeredDone.ts still call
// splitFenceBlocks synchronously during render. The only way to get the bytes back is to stop needing
// the parse in the browser — and a LAZY parse is not it: the degraded return before the module lands
// prints the raw frontmatter at the human, which is the exact bug the paragraph above exists to end.
