// The client half of the GitHub hovercards: one store holding every reference the page has rendered,
// filled by ONE batched request per render burst, read synchronously when a pointer lands on a link.
//
// WHY A MODULE STORE AND NOT useQuery PER ANCHOR. A transcript routinely carries dozens of `#123`
// anchors and the same number appears again and again down one thread. Per-anchor queries would mean
// one request per anchor, a fetch beginning at hover (~300-800ms of GitHub round trip, longer than a
// pointer rests), and a re-request every time virtualization remounts the row. Collecting refs as the
// prose renders instead means the data is already here before anyone points at anything: the hover is
// a Map lookup. It mirrors githubAutolink.ts's own module-scalar-plus-subscription shape, for the same
// reason — this is page-level state that every prose block feeds and any anchor may read.
//
// FRESHNESS is stale-while-revalidate, and the card on screen is never the thing waiting. An entry is
// rendered immediately however old it is; if it is older than CARD_TTL_MS the hover ALSO sends a
// `refresh` for that one ref, and the card updates underneath the reader if the issue moved. The
// server holds its own five-minute TTL, so an ordinary scroll re-uses its cache and only a reader
// genuinely looking at a stale card pays for a fetch.
