// A Windows path is written with backslashes, and CommonMark reads a backslash before punctuation as
// an ESCAPE. `D:\Development\CloudIPMSjb\.frizz\threads\x.md` therefore renders as
// `D:\Development\CloudIPMSjb.frizz\threads\x.md`: `\D`, `\t` and `\x` survive because a letter is
// not punctuation, while `\.` collapses to `.` — one directory silently fused with the next. marked
// applies the rule in prose (an `escape` token) and in a link or image DESTINATION (the tokenizer
// unescapes `href`), so both the label the reader sees and the path the click opens were wrong, and
// the opener was handed a file that does not exist. Every scratch directory is `.frizz`, every
// settings directory is `.claude`, so on Windows the mangled shape was the common case, not an edge.
//
// Inside a Windows path a backslash is a separator, never an escape, so this pass puts the byte back.
// It runs on TOKENS rather than the source for the same reason the GitHub autolinker does: a fenced
// block and a code span are literal by construction and never see it, and nothing here can change
// what marked chose to tokenize — only the text an escape renders as and the href a link carries.

// A destination that is a Windows drive path as the author wrote it. `x://host/p` is a one-letter URL
// scheme, not a drive: only a BACKSLASH after the colon makes a drive path. A doubled `X:\\` is an
// author escaping on purpose — marked's unescape already turns it into the right path — so it is left alone.
const WINDOWS_ABSOLUTE_PATH = /^[a-zA-Z]:\\(?!\\)/

// Where a drive path starts in prose: a letter at a word boundary, then `:` and `\`. Everything after it up
// to the next whitespace is the path. A path with spaces cannot be told from prose in a text token, so
// the run stops at whitespace — the same convention the bare-URL autolinker relies on, and the shape
// agents actually write.
const DRIVE = /(?<![A-Za-z0-9])[A-Za-z]:\\/

// marked's own link grammar, re-applied to a link token's `raw` to read the destination back BEFORE
// the tokenizer's unescape. The token carries only the unescaped href; the raw source still has the
// author's bytes.
const LINK_RULE = Lexer.rules.inline.normal.link

// The walk's view of the current whitespace-free run of prose: whether a drive has opened a path in it,
// and its last three characters — enough for a drive whose letter, colon and backslash straddle tokens
// (marked ends a text token before every backslash, and `C:\.frizz`'s only backslash IS the escape),
// plus the character the letter must not follow. Constant-size on purpose: carrying the whole run and
// re-scanning it per token made one long unbroken word quadratic (80k characters took 13s to render).
