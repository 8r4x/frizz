// The one icon-action treatment used by every button in the top-left status bar (settings, reload).
// It lives here rather than in StatusBar.tsx because RestartFrizzButton also needs it, and importing it
// from StatusBar — which itself renders RestartFrizzButton — would be an import cycle.
//
// 24px square: the WCAG 2.2 minimum pointer target, and the largest size that still reads as part of a
// 12px text strip rather than as chrome parked next to it. The old corner button was 32px, which
// out-weighed the owner/repo label once the two became neighbours.
//
// The hover fill is bg-elevated, one step ABOVE the bar's own bg-panel surface. It was bg-panel back
// when the bar had no background of its own; once the bar became an opaque panel chip, a bg-panel
// hover was the same colour as the thing behind it and the hover simply stopped reading.
//
// `-mx-1.5` IS THE 24px SQUARE'S DEAD SPACE, and it is what makes the bar's one `gap` mean one
// distance. The square is the HOVER TARGET; the mark is the 14px glyph inside it, which paints 12px
// (measured, both glyphs, `scripts/ink-gaps.mjs --pad=0`) — so each button wears 6px of nothing a
// side. On a uniform `gap-2` that drew 20px of ink between the gear and the reload icon against 8px
// between the divider and the first quota chip, and the maintainer read the widest of them straight
// off the pixels (2026-08-14: "there's too much space between these two icons"). Collapsing the box
// onto the ink is the same fix lib/iconRhythm.ts documents for the thread footer, and it leaves the
// two squares exactly touching at the bar's `gap-3` rather than overlapping.
//
// RE-MEASURE, DON'T RE-GUESS, if STATUS_BAR_ICON or the square changes, or if a bar action ever
// carries a glyph whose ink does NOT reach lucide's outer 24-unit bound — this constant is one
// number for both buttons only because their two glyphs happen to paint the same 12px:
//   nub scripts/ink-gaps.mjs http://localhost:<vite>/status-bar-fixture.html \
//     "[data-status-bar] > button:nth-child(3),[data-status-bar] > div:nth-child(4)" --dsf=4 --pad=0
