// (githubAutolink.ts) reads the project's repo from module state, and that state arrives from the board a
// beat after a thread's own transcript query resolves. Every call site used to memoize on the markdown
// STRING alone, so the HTML built during that beat — with no repo, hence no links — was the HTML the
// reader kept for the life of the page. Making the repo a subscribed render input is what fixes it, and
// putting it in one hook is what stops the next markdown surface from reintroducing the bug.
//
// useSyncExternalStore over a SCALAR rather than useSnapshot, matching lib/deliverQueuedNow.ts: this
// runs in every prose block on screen, and the value changes at most once per page.
