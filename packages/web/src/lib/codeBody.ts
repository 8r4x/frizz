// Highlighted markup for the transcript's NON-markdown code surfaces: a Bash card's command, a Read
// card's file excerpt, a background shell's command. Markdown fences have their own renderer
// (syntaxHighlight.ts `renderHighlightedCode`) because they also mint block chrome and a copy button;
// these surfaces already own their `<pre>`, so all they need is the inner markup.
//
// Everything here is layout-NEUTRAL by design. The text content of the result is byte-identical to the
// plain string it replaces, so each surface keeps exactly the wrapping, clamping, selection and copy
// behaviour it has today — only colour is added.

// hljs emits a fragment of nested `<span class="hljs-…">` around already-escaped text, and a token may
// span a newline (a block comment, a template literal). Splitting that fragment on "\n" therefore has
// to close every span still open at the break and re-open it on the next line, or the first multi-line
// comment in a file swallows the rest of the block. Text can never contain a bare "<" — hljs escapes it
// — so a "<" only ever starts a tag.
const TOKEN = /<span\b[^>]*>|<\/span>|\n|[^<\n]+|</g

// Claude's Read tool returns its excerpt in `cat -n` form — a right-aligned line number, a TAB, then the
// source. Highlighting that verbatim would feed a stray integer to the grammar at the head of every
// line, so the gutter is split off, the source is highlighted AS ONE TEXT (which is what keeps a block
// comment or a template literal correct across lines), and the numbers are re-attached as their own
// muted spans. A blank source line still carries its number, so the prefix is matched without requiring
// anything after the tab.

// whole card. Trailing whitespace is normalised at enough points between a tool result and this
// renderer that requiring the tab is simply the wrong contract.

// A file excerpt is only treated as numbered when ALL of its non-empty lines carry a prefix AND at
// least one carries a real tabbed one. Both halves matter: without the first, a prose tool result that
// merely opens with "1\t" has its whole body eaten as gutters; without the second, a data file whose
