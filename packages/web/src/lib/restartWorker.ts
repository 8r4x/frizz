// THE "Restart worker" verb — retire the thread's live `claude` process and continue the SAME
// conversation in a freshly started one.
//
// Why it has to exist at all: a worker inherits its plugin (and therefore its HOOKS) and its system
// prompt at process start, and can never pick either up afterwards. Measured, not assumed — patching a
// Stop hook into a live worker's plugin dir mid-session does nothing, while a brand-new process on that
// same patched dir runs it. So a worker dispatched before a fray build shipped a hook keeps running
// without it for as long as its process lives, however many turns it takes. Nothing the operator can
// type reaches that; only replacing the process does.
//
// It is NOT "start a fresh agent": the transcript is on disk, so the cold resume replays the whole
// conversation into the new process, and the server rebuilds the worker system prompt on the way in.
// The thread keeps its history, its scratchpad and its identity — it just comes back on current tooling.
//
// Delivering a message is the point rather than an afterthought. Retiring the daemon alone would leave
// the operator staring at a card where nothing visibly happened until the thread's next natural wake;
// carrying a continuation makes the restart the observable act it reads as.

  "Your worker process was restarted so it picks up fray's current tooling (hooks and worker contract). Re-read your scratchpad, then continue exactly where you left off."

// Live sub-agents do NOT gate this verb. A restart does kill the parent's in-memory children, and for a
// while that reasoning disabled the button whenever any of them was running — but the operator reaching
// for this verb is the one person who already knows, and the children they were being protected from
// losing are routinely the reason the worker needs replacing in the first place. Making them wait it out
// (maintainer 2026-08-01: "do not disable the button when there are sub-agents running") turned the one
// recovery affordance into a control that is unavailable exactly when it is wanted. The completion
// invariant binds fray's OWN automatic restarts — needsFreshProcessForLimit still refuses to kill a live
// child on its own initiative — not an explicit human instruction.
