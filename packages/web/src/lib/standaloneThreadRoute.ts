 * The href for a thread's standalone `/full` page — an OUTER path, because it goes straight into an

 * It MUST carry the project prefix. One Frizz serves every project on the machine now, so the
 * unprefixed `/thread/<slug>/full` resolves against whichever project happened to launch the server:
 * the ↗ button on a thread in any OTHER project opened a page that either showed the wrong project's
 * thread of the same name or dead-ended in <MissingThread> (maintainer 2026-08-07, on the ↗ button:
 * "this is an old url"). Unprefixed output is still correct — and still what this returns — for the
 * launching project, which is served at the root.
