// PUSH IT THROUGH NOW.
//
// A follow-up sent to a working agent waits in the provider's queue until the current turn ends —
// measured p50 13.8s, p90 49s, p99 2.5m, and the tail is a real 90s tool call. The operator can already
// pay for that wait up front (⌘⏎ sends AND interrupts), but that forces the decision at the moment of
// typing, before they know how long the worker is going to take. This is the same capability offered
// AFTERWARDS, from the one surface that is on screen for the whole wait: the queued bubble.
//
// There is nothing to send here — the words are already queued. All that is left is the interrupt, and
// the SDK's interrupt aborts a turn WITHOUT discarding queued input, so the next turn opens on exactly
// the messages the operator is looking at. That asymmetry is why this needed no new delivery path.
//
// It preempts the TURN, so with several bubbles queued it delivers all of them, in order. The button's
// title says that rather than implying it singles out the one under the pointer.

// Which surfaces can offer this at all: the same broker-backed-Claude boundary as unqueue (a codex
// steer goes straight into the running turn, so there is no queue to jump), plus a turn that is
// actually RUNNING — with the worker at rest there is nothing to interrupt and the button would be a
// dead click. Mirrors `canInterrupt` in ThreadComposerBox, which gates ⌘⏎ on the same two facts.
