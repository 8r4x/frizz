/**
 * The last answer per project, so a reload can RESERVE the sidebar's column before the board arrives.
 *
 * `hasBeenVisible` is derived from the board, and the board is a socket push that lands a beat after
 * React's first render. Until then App painted the workpane centered ALONE, then mounted the sidebar
 * and shoved the workpane 269px right on every reload of a populated project (measured 2026-08-25,
 * 1440px viewport: workpane left 360 → 629). Same cure as the font and the project rail: remember the
 * server's last answer in this browser, and let the first frame use it. Keyed by the project the
 * page names (`projectSlug()`, "" for the unprefixed launching project — the same scope
 * lib/queryKeyScope.ts uses), because it is a per-PROJECT fact on a one-origin app. A project never
 * loaded in this browser gets the fresh-workspace shell, which is what it would have got anyway.
