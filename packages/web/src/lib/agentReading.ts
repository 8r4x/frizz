// WHAT A DISPATCH CARD'S RIGHT-HAND READING SAYS — the whole vocabulary and tone matrix, in one place.
//
// It was previously spread across two renderers inside AgentBlock, chosen by whether the client still
// held a live record for the child, and the two disagreed about everything a reader can see. Eight rows
// of the same kind rendered as: "3m" / "stopped 41m" / "failed 12m" in lowercase sans at three different
// alphas, then "CANCELLED" in amber petite-caps and "FAILED · 12 SEC" in red petite-caps (maintainer
// 2026-07-29: "a bizarre mix of font sizes, color saturations, and capitalization"). Two of those pairs
// were the SAME EVENT twice: a killed child reads "stopped", and a dispatch whose child record aged out
// reads "cancelled" — same interruption, different word, different colour, different typography.
//
// Whether a child record survived is an internal data-availability detail. It must never change the
// words or the tone, so both paths now resolve through this function.
//
// THREE decisions it encodes:
//
//  1. THE WORDS come from AGENT_OUTCOME_VERB, the same map the completion divider reads, and a NOMINAL
//     outcome has none: a card showing a runtime and no liveness mark already means "it ran and stopped"
//     (maintainer 2026-07-29). Only "stopped" and "failed" are things no mark can say.
//
//  2. THE DURATION is spelled out at minute resolution — the form the completion divider two lines below
//     it already uses (formatFixedDuration), so the card and the divider describing one child read
//     identically: "STOPPED · 41 MIN" on both. This deliberately drops the compact "41m" form:
//     durationLabels.ts states the house rule (spell units out in a small-caps status row so an
//     uppercase M cannot read as "million") and scopes the compact exception to the dense child-op row,
//     which is fighting for horizontal room against a ×, a live step and two counters. A dispatch card's
//     reading shares its row with a title and a chevron, so it never qualified for that exception.
//     The precise duration is not lost — it rides the tooltip.
//
//  3. THE TONE is binary. A genuine failure is the red every tool card uses; EVERYTHING else, including
//     an interruption, is the quiet muted gray. Amber is gone from this row: it was saying "caution"
//     about a dispatch someone deliberately stopped.

  //    liveness (maintainer 2026-08-01, of the spinner that used to live here — "a right-justified
  //    spinner with the 'running' label that should not show up under any circumstances"). `pending` is
  //    not evidence a child is alive — the server keeps an Agent launch pending until a task-notification
  //    correlates to it, so a dispatch whose terminal signal never arrived stays pending FOREVER and the
  //    spinner went on advertising a child that had been dead for hours. Liveness is now stated in
  //    exactly one place, the left-hand mark, which requires an OBSERVED live child record.
