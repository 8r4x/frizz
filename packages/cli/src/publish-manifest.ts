/**
 * Manifest surgery for `npm publish`.
 *
 * `frayui` is published straight out of a pnpm workspace, so its build-time dependencies on the
 * sibling packages are declared with pnpm's `workspace:` protocol. pnpm rewrites those to real
 * versions when IT publishes; npm does not — it is not an npm workspace, so `npm publish` would ship
 * `"@fray-ui/server": "workspace:*"` verbatim to the registry, a specifier no registry consumer can
 * ever resolve. The sibling packages are private and intentionally unpublished, and nothing in the
 * shipped bundle needs them at run time (esbuild absorbs them), so the published manifest simply
 * drops them.
 *
 * Only `workspace:` specifiers are removed — a real registry devDependency like esbuild stays, so the
 * published manifest keeps describing how the package is built.
