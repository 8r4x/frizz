// THE MACHINE-LEVEL KEY/VALUE STORE — the counterpart of a project database's `settings` table.
//
// A project's `Storage.getSetting/setSetting` is where a small persistent record goes when it belongs
// to one repository. Until 2026-08-25 there was no equivalent for a record that belongs to the
// OPERATOR — one value for every project the singleton server serves — so each one grew its own file
// with its own reader and writer (`settings.json`, `registry.json`, `cloud.json`), and the next one
// would have too (maintainer: "surely we have some general-purpose system for storing bits of
// persistent configuration like this?"). This is that system: one JSON object at `<data>/config.json`,
// keyed by record name, each value validated by the schema its owner hands in.
//
// The rules every record inherits, so no owner re-derives them:
//   · a read never throws and never rewrites — a missing file, bad JSON or a value that fails the
//     owner's schema all read as `undefined`, and the owner falls back to whatever it fell back to
//     before (a project row, a shipped default);
//   · a write is read-modify-write of the whole object, open(w) → fsync → rename, so a reader never
//     sees a half file and one key's write cannot drop another key — safe because the singleton is the
//     only writer and node's sync fs calls serialize it;
//   · a write that fails is swallowed: these are preferences, not state, and failing to persist a font
//     must never fail the save that carried it.
//
// `home` is REQUIRED and deliberately not defaulted to homedir() — see settings.ts for the run that
// silently rewrote the maintainer's own notifications flag when a test defaulted it.
