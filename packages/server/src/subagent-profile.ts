// THE DISPATCH PROFILE CELL — the one string every surface that names a sub-agent reads its model and
// effort off (the transcript's dispatch card, the drawer's readout, the rail row tooltip, the resting
// card's child line). It is composed here, on the server, for the same reason the codex spawn cell is
// (`describeCell` in codex-subagents.ts, `codexAgentCell` in transcript.ts): a reader wants ONE cell
// naming the runtime, and deriving it per surface is how two of them come to disagree.
//
// Why it needs composing at all: until 2026-08-26 a Claude dispatch named both halves in one string
// (`frizz:opus-high`), so `subagent_type` verbatim WAS the cell. Splitting the profiles to effort-only
// (`frizz:high`, the model on the Agent tool's own `model` parameter — commit e6f30cf8) left every one
// of those surfaces reading an effort with no model beside it, and the model recorded nowhere at all.
// This puts it back in the canonical form the parsers already speak, so nothing downstream had to learn
// a second shape (web/lib/subAgentProfile.ts renders both, and has since before the split).
//
// AN OMITTED `model` IS NOT AN UNKNOWN ONE — for a profile frizz itself ships. The Agent tool resolves
// an omitted model to "the agent definition's model, or inherits from the parent", and frizz's own
// `frizz:<effort>` definitions pin effort ONLY (cc-worker/agents/*.md), so for those the parent's is
// the answer. The dispatching assistant record states exactly what the parent was running
// (`message.model` on 33493/33493 records measured across this machine's corpus, `effort` on 33430),
// so the cell resolves from that TURN rather than the session's current profile: a thread whose model
// changed mid-run still reads each dispatch at the model it actually launched under.
//
// A FOREIGN agent type inherits NOTHING here. `general-purpose`, `Explore` or a project's own
// `.claude/agents/*.md` may pin a model or effort frizz cannot see, and a cell that guessed the
// parent's would state a runtime the child never ran at. Such a dispatch keeps its type name and shows
// only what the call itself named — which is still everything the card showed before this existed.
