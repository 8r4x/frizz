// Fray's SQLite driver: better-sqlite3's SHAPE, node:sqlite's implementation.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. better-sqlite3 is a native addon, and a native addon carries a Node-API floor
// that moves without warning. Its 13.x prebuild is built with `NAPI_VERSION=10`, which exists only
// from Node 22.14 and 23.6, while the package itself declares `engines: ">=22"` — so on Node 22.12 it
// does not fail to load, it SEGFAULTS inside `napi_module_register_by_symbol`, killing the board
// before it can report anything. `node:sqlite` is built into the runtime: no prebuild, no ABI, no
// floor of its own beyond the release that shipped it (22.13 / 23.4), and no way for that floor to
// change under a `pnpm update`.
//
// This adapter keeps the ~300 existing `prepare`/`run`/`get`/`all` call sites exactly as they were.
// It is intentionally NOT a general better-sqlite3 polyfill — it implements the surface Fray actually
// uses and nothing else, so there is no dead code pretending to be supported.
//
// The differences it has to paper over were MEASURED against better-sqlite3 13.0.2, not assumed:
//   • node:sqlite rejects unknown keys in a named-parameter object; better-sqlite3 ignores them, and
//     Fray relies on that — it passes whole row objects to statements that bind a subset.
//   • node:sqlite refuses to bind `undefined`; better-sqlite3 binds NULL, and Fray's row types are
//     full of optional fields.
//   • node:sqlite binds a MISSING named parameter as NULL instead of throwing. That one is a silent
//     data-corruption hazard in a persistence layer, so it is re-implemented here rather than lost.
//   • `exec()` returns the database in better-sqlite3 and undefined in node:sqlite.
//   • node:sqlite has no `pragma()` and no `transaction()` at all.

// esbuild's bundle — above the inlined body of `sqlite-quiet.ts` — so in the published artifact the
// warning was emitted before the filter that suppresses it was installed. It leaked into the launcher
// readout on Node 22.13, and only the built artifact showed it; the dev source, which is not bundled,
// looked fine. A require() is a plain call expression, so it runs where it is written.
