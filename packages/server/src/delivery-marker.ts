// ── The invisible delivery marker ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHAT OF IT STILL RUNS. frizz used to steer a Claude worker by pasting into a
// human-facing TUI composer, and that channel REWROTE the bytes on the way through. Measured against a
// live claude 2.1.219 TUI, driven by frizz's own paste sequence: the paste transport turned LF into CR,
// then the TUI's paste handler turned CR/CRLF back into LF and expanded every TAB into four spaces — so
// a tab-bearing send and a CRLF-bearing send both arrived as different bytes than frizz sent. Confirming
// delivery by comparing those bytes was therefore inference, and every mangling class frizz had not yet
// met stranded a send as "unconfirmed" while the agent had already read and acted on it.
//
// This replaced the inference with IDENTITY. Every follow-up frizz pasted carried a marker encoding its
// deliveryId, so the correlator recognised its own send by looking the id up rather than by comparing
// prose. That was immune to any rewrite of the surrounding text, and it stayed correct when the TUI
// glued several sends into one submission — each constituent brought its own marker along.
//
// The broker path needs no marker: frizz hands the SDK a `uuid` with every input and the SDK echoes it
// back on the record that materializes it, so delivery-ledger.ts resolves the send from that id (see its
// IDENTITY section) and nothing emits a marker any more. What still runs here is the READ side —
// decodeDeliveryMarkers for a record that predates the cutover, and above all stripDeliveryMarkers,
// which transcript.ts applies to every record so a marker in an older transcript can neither reach a
// human's eyes nor perturb a text comparison.
//
// ── Why zero-width, and why these three codepoints ────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The marker had to survive the channel and had to stay invisible to the human reading their own
// terminal. Measured on the same live TUI: U+200B / U+200C / U+2060 round-tripped BYTE-INTACT through
// the paste transport and the composer into the JSONL, and the terminal rendered the line with no
// visible artefact. They are also deliberately NOT matched by JavaScript's `\s`, so a marker can never
// be mistaken for the whitespace the ledger's text comparison collapses.
//
// The cost was honest and bounded: the model saw 34 invisible codepoints at the end of each steer. frizz
// owns every surface that renders this text, so the marker is stripped from the transcript before the
// human ever sees it (see stripDeliveryMarkers).
//
// ── Why this cannot resolve the wrong send ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//  1. The tag is a 32-bit hash of the deliveryId, so two DIFFERENT sends colliding inside one ledger
//     (≤20 items) is a ~1-in-10^7 event — and the correlator does not gamble on it anyway: it refuses
//     the marker path for any tag held by more than one outstanding item and falls back to text.
//  2. A marker only ever resolves an item whose evidence is CONTEMPORANEOUS, exactly as text evidence
//     does. A replayed transcript cannot resurrect an old send.
//  3. A marker is never SYNTHESISED from anything the human typed — it is emitted only by frizz's own
//     injection path, so a human pasting prose into the terminal cannot forge one.
