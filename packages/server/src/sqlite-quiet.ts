// Imported for its SIDE EFFECT, and imported BEFORE `node:sqlite` anywhere it is used.
//
// `node:sqlite` is Stability 1.2 (release candidate) and emits an ExperimentalWarning to stderr the
// first time it is loaded. Frizz's launcher paints a compact readout there, so an unsolicited Node
// warning lands in the middle of it — and the operator can do nothing about a warning describing an
// implementation detail they did not choose. Which releases warn is not even monotonic (measured:
// 22.14 and 24.1 warn, 24.17 is silent, 25.0-25.2 warn again, 25.8+ silent), so suppressing it is the
// only stable behaviour available.
//
// The filter is deliberately narrow: it drops ONLY node:sqlite's own experimental notice and forwards
// every other warning untouched, so a genuine deprecation or leak warning still reaches the log.
