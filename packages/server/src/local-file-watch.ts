// ONE LIVE WATCH PER OPEN FILE, for the readers that render a file on disk — the /full page's split
// viewer and the Markdown drawer. Each read ONCE and rendered what it got, so a file a worker was
// editing sat stale on screen until the reader closed and reopened it (maintainer 2026-09-03: "seems
// like we load the file once … and don't monitor it for changes … it needs to be live"). A watch here
// tells the socket layer "read it again"; the bytes still travel through the reader's own gated RPC.
//
// THE WATCH IS ON THE DIRECTORY, filtered to the file's own name — never on the file itself. Every
// editor worth the name saves ATOMICALLY (write a temp file, rename it over the original), so a watch
// on the file follows the OLD inode into the void and reports nothing ever again; the directory sees
// the rename land under the same name. It also sees the file deleted and recreated, which from where
// the reader stands is the same instruction.
//
// Non-recursive, so watching a file at the checkout's root costs a watch on the root's direct entries
// and nothing under node_modules. The several events one save produces (a rename, a change or two)
// coalesce behind a short timer, so the reader re-reads once per save rather than once per event.
//
// Shared by canonical path: two readers on one file (a panel plus a stacked drawer, or two tabs) hold
// one OS watch between them, and the last one to leave closes it.
//
// AND THE NAME FILTER IS NOT ENOUGH ON MACOS, which is why every settled burst is checked against the
// file's own stat before anyone is told about it. A directory watch is supposed to name the entry that
// moved, and on Linux it does; on macOS the creation of a SIBLING emits a `rename` carrying OUR file's
// name as well as the sibling's. Measured 2026-09-04 — one `writeFileSync` of `other.md` beside a
// watched `doc.md` produced, in order, `["change","<the directory>"]`, `["rename","doc.md"]` and
// `["rename","other.md"]`. Nothing in the first two is distinguishable from a real save, so the
// listener fired on a file that had not changed a byte: an open reader at a checkout's root re-read
// itself on every unrelated save in that directory, and local-file-watch.test.ts's negative control
// ("a sibling's save is not this file's change") failed 3 runs out of 3.
//
// The stamp is inode, size and NANOSECOND mtime, so it separates two saves inside one millisecond —
// which the coarser mtimeMs would not, and a missed save is the one failure this module must not have.
// A file that cannot be stat'ed stamps as "gone", which is a change like any other: the delete fires,
// and so does the recreate that follows it onto the same watch.
