// The in-process integration harness: a REAL frizz server graph — storage, tailer, board, runtime
// ingest — booted against a temp project, driven by a scripted provider, with no LLM, no daemon and
// no browser.
//
// This is plans/t3code-adoption-spike.md item 4, and it exists because of the cost asymmetry the
// briefing names: frizz's only gate for orchestration logic today is "launch a promoted artifact,
// drive real Chrome, screenshot". That is exactly right for UI and ruinously expensive for the
// question "when the SDK says the turn is over before the transcript says so, does the board queue
// the thread with the right final message?" — which is a pure orchestration question, and which is
// where this spike's risk actually lives.
//
// Determinism comes from the two primitives in @frizz/shared rather than from sleeping:
//   * `ingest.drain()` — every event handed in has been folded and its nudge issued.
//   * `receipts.waitFor(…, { since })` — the exact milestone, matched even if it landed before the
//     await. Capture `receipts.cursor()` BEFORE playing a script.
// No assertion in a test built on this may wait on wall-clock time.
