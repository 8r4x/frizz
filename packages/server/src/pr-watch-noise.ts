// The exclusion list for registered PR watchers: which new reviews and comments must NOT wake a worker.
//
// MEASURED, not guessed. 2026-08-26, over 1,028 public Pullfrog-customer PRs (205 repos, 8,979 wake-
// eligible items — every `review` + issue-level `comment` node the poller can see). 80% of that
// activity is bot-authored, and the maintainer's complaint (2026-08-28: "the watcher keeps on waking
// up agents with bullshit … comments from things like Vercel and from Linear that are just not really
// high signal") is about a SUBSET of it. Edits were ruled out first: the poller keys on the immutable
// node id and never asks for `lastEditedAt`, so every bump is a genuinely new item — Vercel edits its
// deploy table in place, which wakes once per PR, not once per deployment. The corpus and the script
// that re-derives every figure here live in `.frizz/pr-watch-noise/` (gitignored, 17MB).
//
// The rule is DELIBERATELY not "mute all bots" — that filter was tried and reverted (see
// `isBotGithubActor`): Pullfrog, CodeRabbit, Copilot, Cursor, Codex, cubic, Greptile and Qodo all post
// real review from a Bot actor. So three tiers, each narrower than the last, and a human item is never
// muted by any of them. Together they drop 1,940 of the 8,979 items (21.6%), with 0 human items.
//
// ONE clean-bill rule is deliberately ABSENT: Pullfrog's own `✅ No new issues found.` re-review (~280
// items in the corpus, the single biggest lever left). A clean verdict on the worker's own PR is
// arguably the answer it was waiting for, so it stays live; the maintainer chose that on 2026-08-28.

/** Tier 1 — the actor never carries review substance: deploy previews, coverage badges, changeset
 *  notices, issue linkbacks, package previews, greeters. Logins are the GRAPHQL form, with NO `[bot]`
 *  suffix — REST adds it, GraphQL does not, and a list written as `vercel[bot]` matches nothing
 *  (`isNoisePrActivity` strips a suffix defensively, but keep the list in this form).
 *  `socket-security` and `codspeed-hq` are NOT here on purpose: their `[!WARNING]` dependency alerts
 *  and "degrade performance by 12%" reports are review, so they get a body rule below instead. */
