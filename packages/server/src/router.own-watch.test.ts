// THE WORKER'S OWN WATCH REGISTRY at the RPC boundary — the real router against real SQLite.
//
// `mcp__frizz__watch` registers a wait on work this thread already has running, so that coming to rest
// stops being a line the worker restates in a fence at every rest (plans/rest-by-registration.md). What
// makes this registry different from the PR one is that its target cannot be validated by SHAPE: a
// background shell's handle and a sub-agent's handle are both opaque runtime strings that overlap
// completely, so the only exact answer available is live telemetry's.
//
// Every test here is a way a worker could come to rest believing it is covered when it is not.
