// A completion report is only THIS session's to repair if THIS session launched the op.
//
// The runtime writes the `queue-operation` bookkeeping for every background op into the ROOT
// transcript — a sub-agent's included — and the record names no owner. A descendant's op is delivered
// into the DESCENDANT's transcript, which this TailState never reads, so from here it looks queued and
// never delivered: byte-for-byte the signature of the runtime drop the repair exists to fix. Without an
// owner test frizz injected other agents' completions into this one, telling it that work it never
// started was lost. Measured over four real threads, 66% of the completed background-op notifications
// in a parent transcript belong to a descendant, and on the one thread where the repair was live all
// 283 of its relays were for ops that session never launched.
