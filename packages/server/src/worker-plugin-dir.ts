// The frizz-worker plugin (single-thread worker contract + hooks + the worker-facing bin/ scripts), a
// sibling of board/ in the Frizz source tree. Deployed artifacts carry it at runtime/cc-worker, but
// pnpm may load this module through a nested store rather than the flat node_modules layout. Search
// module ancestors so the closure remains discoverable in either layout; an explicitly verified
// artifact path wins.
//
// This lives in its own leaf module (node builtins only) rather than in dispatch.ts, where it was born
// and from which it is still re-exported. The cycle that split it out is gone: backend/types.ts needed
// it to resolve `bin/browser-mcp.mjs` for the always-mounted browser, and dispatch.ts imports
// backend/types.ts. The browser mount was removed 2026-08-26 and dispatch.ts is now the only importer,
// so the leaf could fold back — it stays because the split costs nothing and every caller reaches for
// the dispatch.ts re-export. The ancestor walk is unaffected either way: this file sits in the same
// directory dispatch.ts does, so the default `import.meta.url` starts from the same place.
