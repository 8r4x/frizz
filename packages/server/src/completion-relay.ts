// ── Sub-agent report delivery repair ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A background sub-agent's final report reaches its parent as a completion `<task-notification>`, and
// that notification rides THREE record shapes in the session JSONL (see tailer.ts `notificationText`).
// Two of them are NOT equivalent to the third, and conflating them is the bug this module exists for:
//
//   queue-operation  — the runtime ACCEPTED the notification into its input queue. Bookkeeping only.
//                      The model has not seen a word of it.
//   user record      — MODEL-FACING. The report is in the agent's context.
//   attachment       — (`type:"queued_command"`) MODEL-FACING. Same.
//
// MEASURED ON THE OPERATOR'S OWN CORPUS (2026-07-30, two real nub threads): a large fraction of
// `status=completed` notifications appear ONLY as queue-operations — an `enqueue` followed by a
// `remove`, with no `user` record and no attachment anywhere in the file. Raw-grepping every line that
// mentions those task-ids finds exactly those two records and nothing else. On the busier thread that
// was 39 of 117 completed reports (33%); the dropped payloads ran 3.3k–23.6k characters and were
// finished adversarial reviews — "3 HARD COMPILE breaks", "2 blocking, 2 should-fix", "Two hard
// CI-gate breaks". The orchestrator landed those diffs believing they had been reviewed. Worse, frizz's
// own timeline rendered NOTHING for them, because the tailer retires a sub-agent row on any terminal
// notification regardless of carrier — so the row simply vanished and the loss was invisible.
//
// Payload size was the obvious suspect and is NOT the mechanism: 3,318 chars was dropped on that same
// thread while 12,299 was delivered. The drop is upstream of frizz, inside a dependency we do not own
// (Claude Code's own queue, SDK stream-json under the broker — frizz only ever READS these records).
//
// So this module does not try to explain the drop. It observes the model-facing carriers directly and
// repairs on ABSENCE, which is correct whatever the upstream cause turns out to be.
//
// IDEMPOTENCE IS CARRIED BY THE TRANSCRIPT, not by a persisted flag. The repair frizz injects is itself
// a user record, and it embeds `RELAY_MARKER` + the task-id. On any later re-fold — a frizz restart, a
// cold resume, a full re-read of the file — that record is model-facing evidence for exactly this
// task-id, so the report resolves as delivered and is never repaired twice. Nothing to persist,
// nothing to migrate, and the evidence lives in the same file as the thing it is evidence about.

// that was lost last Tuesday is history, and replaying it teaches the agent nothing it can act on.

// the cause, a back-filled terminal state on the launch card, and a broken merge chain. It owed all
// three and paid none, because the repair is PROSE rather than a `<task-notification>`: completionEvents
// skipped it and isInjectedNoise then swallowed the record whole.
//
// Measured on a fixture against the delivered control, changing only how the completion arrived: three
// messages with a `completed` card became ONE message whose card was stuck on `pending`, the post-wake
// turn folded into the launch bubble, and nothing anywhere named the cause. That is what a maintainer
// hit on 2026-08-05 — "it looks like the agent came to rest, then re-triggered with no external event
// triggering" — after the only visible wake source on the thread had been switched off, leaving 55
// relays as the sole driver and every one of them silent.
//
// The comment at RELAY_MARKER is still right that frizz should not NARRATE its own plumbing at the
// human. Showing that a background task finished is not narrating plumbing: that event is already a
// first-class divider when the runtime delivers it, and hiding it only when frizz is the one carrying it
// makes the timeline lie about why the agent moved.
//
// Rather than grow a second projection path, a relay is translated BACK into the notification it stands
// for and handed to the one that already exists. The delimiters below are the ones `relayMessage` writes
// a few lines up — parsed and written in the same file precisely so they cannot drift apart.
