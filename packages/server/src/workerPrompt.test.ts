// what to do, it produced the analysis, asked one design question, got no answer for 36 hours, and then
// — under a Goal telling it that a written-up plan is not an ending and that unanswered calls are its own
// to make — decided the question itself and shipped seven commits, a moved global bin dir, shell-profile
// writing and a docs change. Nothing woke it but its own background completions.
//
// "Keep going" is unbounded by construction: there is always more to do in any repo, so a worker
// forbidden to stop can only stop by widening its remit. Both halves have to be in the contract.
