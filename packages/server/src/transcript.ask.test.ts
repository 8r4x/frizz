// The NATIVE QUESTION projection. The line this file defends: an `AskUserQuestion` tool_use carries its
// structured questions onto the transcript card (`ask`), and its result — answered or withdrawn — only
// changes the card's settled state, never erases the question. This is the durable record behind the
// interaction card: a follow-up sent instead of an answer retires the pending card (the broker denies
// the parked call), and before this the transcript then held only a generic tool line, so the question
// vanished (maintainer 2026-08-30: "the questions should continue to render as they were from earlier
// in the transcript, even if they weren't answered"). Record shapes are copied from real session logs.
