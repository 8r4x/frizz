// A LEASE on a provisioned runtime: "a live process still executes out of this version directory".
//
// runtimes.ts sweeps every version directory the current pin superseded, and until 2026-09-10 it did
// so on sight. That evening a source-tree stack pinned to Claude Code 2.1.268 booted against the
// machine's real `~/.frizz/runtimes` root (the ad-hoc stack shares it on purpose, to skip a 200 MB
// download) and retired `claude/2.1.267/` — the directory the RUNNING 0.12.9 server handed to every
// broker it forked. Daemons already up kept going (the binary stays mapped after the unlink); every
// NEW thread died before it could publish its record, and the operator saw only "Claude broker …
// did not become ready" for the rest of the day. The header of runtimes.ts had already named "a pin
// that can vanish under a running server" as the worst failure; the sweep was the one causing it.
//
// So a directory is only swept when nobody holds a live lease on it. A lease is a file named by pid
// under `<versionDir>/.leases/`, written by the server the moment it resolves a pin and by each
// detached daemon when it starts (a daemon outlives the server that forked it, and the codex
// app-server spawns helpers out of its own version directory long after boot). Liveness is the pid,
// checked with a null signal at sweep time, so a lease needs no refresh and a crash leaves nothing
// that lingers past the next sweep. A reused pid keeps a directory one sweep longer, which is the
// harmless direction.
//
// Deliberately tiny and fs-only: both daemon bundles import this, and neither should drag the
// provisioner's fetch/tar code along.
