// SUB-AGENTS ENDED BY AN INTERRUPT — the note the worker gets when "interrupt and send" kills its children.
//
// The SDK's `query.interrupt()` aborts the turn WITHOUT discarding queued input (that is what makes
// interrupt-and-send work at all — see the bridge's `interruptTurn` contract), but it also aborts every
// BACKGROUND task the turn owned: each child's sidecar flips to `stoppedByUser` at the interrupt
// instant and its transcript ends on `[Request interrupted by user]`. The runtime tells the worker
// nothing, so it goes on believing the child is live. On the nub thread
// `looks-like-my-github-account-was` (2026-09-24) two successive interrupts killed the same daemon
// sub-agent twice (01:06:21Z, 03:11:32Z); the worker parked on `agents: [abc9b9b5f0da4c677]` and was
// bumped NOT RUNNING, and the bump never reached it because each next follow-up superseded it.
//
// The fix the maintainer chose: tell the worker WHAT DIED. The router snapshots the running children
// just before it interrupts, then this module waits for the tailer to retire them — the note names
// only a child the tailer reports KILLED, never one it presumed dead and never one that simply
// finished in the same window — and enqueues one wake through the ordinary outbox (scheduler SOURCE
// 10, `interrupt-ended:<instant>`), which is quiet-window exempt and deliverable into the busy turn the
// interrupt just opened.
//
// SINCE ff71234e (same day) THE SDK QUERY DECLARES `perTaskStopAffordance`, and an interrupt through a
// daemon forked on that build spares the children: this note then never fires, which is the point of
// gating on what the tailer saw. It still covers a daemon forked BEFORE that build (a detached daemon
// outlives a frizz upgrade by hours) and any runtime that regresses to killing them.
