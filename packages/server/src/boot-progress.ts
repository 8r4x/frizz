// ── Boot progress, published for the launcher ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A launcher spawns the control plane DETACHED and then waits for /health. Until this existed the wait
// was a flat 30s deadline against a process it could not see inside: a boot that was working fine but
// slow (a first-ever boot of a large board, or any boot on a loaded machine) hit the deadline, the
// launcher printed "Fray did not become healthy", and the child carried on booting and bound the port —
// so the operator got an error AND a stray control plane contending with their next attempt.
//
// The child now names what it is doing, as it does it. That converts the launcher's question from
// "has 30 seconds elapsed?" (which says nothing about whether anything is wrong) to "has this boot
// stopped making progress?" (which is the actual failure), and lets the give-up message say where it
// got stuck instead of just how long it waited.
//
// Transient IPC, not durable state: written without fsync, removed once the server is listening, and
// every read/write is best-effort. A missing or unparseable file simply means "no progress signal",
// which degrades the launcher to its historical flat deadline.
