/**
 * Response compression for the RPC surface.
 *
 * Measured on this project's real board payload (472 threads, 780 KB of JSON), which is what every
 * page load fetches and what made a remote board feel slow — the server answered in 11 ms and then
 * pushed 780 KB up a home connection through the tunnel:
 *
 *   gzip  q6   159 KB    8.6 ms   4.9x
 *   br    q4   150 KB    5.6 ms   5.2x     <- chosen
 *   br    q11  124 KB   940.1 ms  6.3x     <- better ratio, absurd for a per-request path
 *
 * Brotli at q4 beats gzip q6 on BOTH size and time, so it is preferred when the client accepts it.
 * q11 is the trap: the extra 26 KB costs almost a second of CPU on every request.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT applied to the SSE stream. Compressing a long-lived event stream buffers frames
 * until the compressor decides to flush, which turns a live board into a stuttering one — the exact
 * failure this is supposed to fix, moved somewhere worse.
