// FINDING A PROJECT'S OWN ICON, in the project.
//
// The rail draws one square per project, and a machine with forty of them is unreadable as forty
// identical monograms. Almost every project already ships the picture it wants to be known by — a
// favicon, an apple-touch-icon, a logo in `public/` — so the icon is nearly always THERE, sitting in
// a handful of conventional places, and the only reason it isn't on screen is that nobody looked.
//
// NOTHING ON NPM DOES THIS. Searched 2026-08-06: every "favicon" package is one of two other things —
// a fetcher that takes a URL and hits the live site (`favicon-fetch`, `get-website-favicon`,
// `parse-favicon`) or a generator that takes one source image and produces an icon set (`favicons`).
// Neither knows a thing about where a checkout keeps its logo, which is the entire question here.
//
// TWO PROPERTIES SHAPE THE WHOLE FILE, and both come from the scale:
//
//   · It must be CHEAP. Forty projects × a recursive walk is not a thing to do while someone waits,
//     so this never recurses. It reads a fixed table of directories one level deep (plus one level of
//     monorepo expansion) and stops after a bounded number of files. A repo with 200k files under
//     `node_modules` costs exactly as much as an empty one.
//   · It must PREFER THE BIG SQUARE ONE. `favicon.ico` is usually 16px and looks like mud at 32; the
//     512px `apple-touch-icon.png` sitting beside it is the icon a person would have picked. So the
//     favicon is a WAYFINDER rather than the answer — finding one marks its directory as this
//     project's icon home and lifts everything in it, which is how the larger sibling wins.
//
// The output is a path. Serving it, caching it, and letting the operator override it belong to
// project-registry.ts and the `/_frizz/project-icon` route.
