// Collect the unix-socket FILES that frizz's detached daemons leave behind, without ever touching a
// live one. Extracted verbatim from codex-app-server-daemon.ts (which was the only caller) so the
// Claude session broker's sockets get the identical treatment rather than a second, subtly weaker
// implementation.
//
// The leak: a daemon that was SIGKILLed, or that skipped its own cleanup because a SUCCESSOR already
// owned its record, leaves its socket file behind forever. Nothing ever revisits those paths — a host
// only ever considers the one path belonging to the session/project it is connecting for — so they
// accumulate. Measured 2026-07-27 in this machine's $TMPDIR: ~119 dead `frizz-claude-*.sock` against
// ~4 live ones.
//
// SAFETY IS THE ENTIRE DESIGN, and the danger is the opposite of the obvious one: a naive sweep does
// not merely delete a file, it can delete a LIVE SUCCESSOR's socket — the corpse-deletes-successor bug
// this repo has been bitten by — and merely CONNECTING to a live socket is itself destructive, because
// both daemons treat a new connection as the client taking over (the codex daemon destroys the previous
// socket; the broker reassigns `client` and drains its event backlog into whoever just connected). So:
//
//   1. `lsof -U` names every unix-socket endpoint on the machine. A path ANY process still references
//      is never probed at all — not even connected to.
//   2. Only then is the path probed, and the connection must be REFUSED (ECONNREFUSED/ENOENT — kernel
//      proof that no listener is bound) before anything is unlinked. A probe that CONNECTS means lsof
//      was wrong; that path is left alone.
//   3. No lsof, lsof failing, or an unreadable directory ⇒ sweep NOTHING. Absence of evidence is never
//      taken as evidence of death.
//
// Every step is fire-and-forget and unref'd: this is opportunistic housekeeping and must never hold
// the event loop open or delay the caller.
