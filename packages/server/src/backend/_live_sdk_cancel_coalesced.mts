// LIVE PROBE: the COALESCING hazard — can cancelling one queued message destroy a DIFFERENT one the
// operator never retracted, and lie about it?
//   nub packages/server/src/backend/_live_sdk_cancel_coalesced.mts
//
// The SDK's own .d.ts (SDKControlInterruptResponse.still_queued) says:
//
//   "uuids still in the queue are individually cancellable via cancel_async_message; once a batch is
//    dequeued and coalesced into one turn, cancelling a NON-representative member uuid is a no-op
//    (its content still runs), while cancelling the batch-representative uuid drops the WHOLE
//    coalesced batch — in both cases the cancel response reports cancelled:false"
//
// If that is reachable, frizz's unqueue has a SILENT DESTRUCTION path, because `cancelled:false` is
// exactly what frizz renders as "the agent already picked that message up — it's on its way":
//   · frizz writes no tombstone, so every bubble stays on screen looking delivered;
//   · but B — which the operator never touched — never runs, and nothing anywhere says so.
//
// _live_sdk_cancel_queued.mts already covered the EASY case (both still in the queue: cancelling A
// left B untouched and B ran). This one deliberately aims at the window AFTER the drain begins.
//
// The experiment: queue A and B behind a short first turn, then fire the cancel at A the instant that
// turn's result lands — the moment the drain loop coalesces the queue into the next turn. Repeat a few
// times, since the window is a race and one miss proves nothing.
//
// RESULT, 2026-07-28, claude 2.1.220 / SDK 0.3.207, 9 rounds across two probe designs: the hazard was
// never reached. Every round answered `false` honestly and BOTH messages ran. The coalescing control
// below (one `queued_command` attachment carrying both prompts) never fired, so this is INCONCLUSIVE
// rather than a clean bill of health — read the verdict line, not the absence of failures.
//
// So frizz does not depend on the answer. `cancelled:false` is surfaced as "that message has already
// left the queue", never as "the agent has it", and a refusal writes no tombstone — so anything frizz
// could not retract keeps rendering as an undelivered gray bubble under either reading. This probe
// stays here to be re-run against future CLI builds, and to be extended if someone finds the shape
// that does coalesce (`turns` is reported per round because a single result covering both messages is
// the other candidate signal, and the two did not agree here).
