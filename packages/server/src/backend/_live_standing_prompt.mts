// LIVE END-TO-END: an operator's standing prompt bumps a REAL resting agent at every rest, and the
// agent's own ALLDONE stops it.
//   nub packages/server/src/backend/_live_standing_prompt.mts
//
// This is the proof for the feature, and the THIRD assertion is the one that matters. A standing prompt
// with no terminating condition is an infinite bump generator, so what has to be shown is not "fray can
// re-send text" but the whole handshake: bump at rest → agent works → bump again at the NEXT rest →
// agent says there is nothing left → fray goes quiet and STAYS quiet.
//
// Everything in the chain is the shipping thing: real `claude` broker session → real tailer fold (which
// is where the sentinel is recognized) → real scheduler pass → real broker followUp → real agent turn.
//
// WHAT IS SIMULATED, AND WHY THAT IS THE RIGHT LINE. The prompt is armed by writing the session row
// directly (storage.setStandingPromptIfCurrent) rather than by clicking the footer popover. The click →
// RPC half is a typed router mutation checked by the rpc-contract drift gate and by standing-prompt
// tests; what only a live run can prove is the half below — that a real agent receives the bump at rest,
// acts on it, receives another at its next rest, and that its own sentinel closes the loop.
//
// The rate floor is defeated deliberately (each stage re-arms with a fresh generation, which drops the
// last-fired stamp) so the probe does not spend 30s per bump proving a constant.
