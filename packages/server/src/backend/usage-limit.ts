// ---- SUBSCRIPTION USAGE-LIMIT DETECTION (the auto-resume feature's read side) -------------------
// When a Claude subscription window is exhausted mid-turn, the CLI does NOT crash: it appends one
// SYNTHETIC assistant record and stops. Verified shape (claude-code 2.1.216, real transcripts):
//
//   {"type":"assistant","timestamp":"…","message":{"model":"<synthetic>","stop_reason":"stop_sequence",
//     "content":[{"type":"text","text":"You've hit your session limit · resets 5:50pm (America/Los_Angeles)"}]},
//    "error":"rate_limit","apiErrorStatus":429,"isApiErrorMessage":true}
//
// `error:"rate_limit"` is a STRUCTURAL discriminator, not a text guess: across the whole local corpus
// it appears on session/weekly-limit records and NOTHING else (connection failures carry
// "server_error"; Overloaded and the 400 consumer-terms notice carry "unknown"). So detection keys on
// the structured field and the text is parsed only for the two things the field doesn't carry — WHICH
// window blew, and when it resets.
//
// stop_reason "stop_sequence" is neither end_turn nor tool_use, so computeTurn's unknown-stop-reason
// backstop lands the thread IDLE ~5s later. That idle-with-a-live-limit-fault state is exactly the
// "was running when the limit hit" set the scheduler resumes.

// Which subscription window the provider says is exhausted. The 5-hour window ("session limit")
// always resets within 5 hours, so its wall-clock reset text resolves unambiguously to the next
// occurrence. The weekly window can be days out, so its text-only clock is NOT resolvable — that
// case defers to the quota endpoint for an exact instant (see resolveResetInstant's callers).

// ---- The LATCH: why a resume sometimes needs a whole new process ----------------------------------

// A `claude` process that takes a usage-limit 429 LATCHES on it. Every later input is refused by the
// PROCESS, locally: it answers in ~1s with a byte-identical synthetic record naming the same reset
// clock, without reaching the API at all. Nothing delivered over the existing session clears it —
// not a "continue", not a fresh credential.
//
// Measured live 2026-07-30 on a five-thread fleet. The operator's credential rotator swapped in an
// account with 99% headroom at 17:05:54Z; the same processes went on emitting `resets 11:20am` at
// 17:06, 17:08, 17:10, 17:12, 17:15 and 17:17, while a brand-new `claude -p` on that same repaired
// credential answered normally in the same minute. Killing the process and cold-resuming its
// transcript brought every one of them straight back.
//
// This is why the auto-resume feature worked for as long as its only trigger was the reset clock: by
// the time that clock passes, the process's own latch has expired too, so poking the live session is
// enough. The account-HEADROOM trigger broke that alignment — it exists precisely to resume EARLY,
// off a fresh sign-in or a rotated account, at a moment the latch is still holding. An early resume
// is therefore deliverable only into a process that has never seen the 429.
