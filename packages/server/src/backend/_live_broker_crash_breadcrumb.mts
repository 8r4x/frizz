// LIVE PROBE: when the broker daemon throws where nothing is catching, does it still say so?
//   nub packages/server/src/backend/_live_broker_crash_breadcrumb.mts
//
// Why this exists. Every deliberate exit path in claude-agent-broker.ts records a breadcrumb — the
// signal handlers, shutdown(), the event pump, the reachability self-collection. A throw that reached
// nobody recorded nothing, and node's default for that (print a stack, exit 1) writes the stack to a
// stdio the HOST sets to "ignore" (forkClaudeBroker in claude-broker-host.ts). So the diagnostics log
// simply ended, which is byte-identical to what an external SIGKILL leaves behind.
//
// That ambiguity was not academic. Measured across this machine's whole broker corpus on 2026-08-02:
// 276 daemon `started` records against 223 recorded exits — 53 deaths (~19%) with no attribution at
// all, reported to the operator as "the broker daemon is gone and left no exit record (killed
// outright, or it predates exit breadcrumbs)". With no breadcrumb there was no way to tell fray's own
// unhandled throw from something outside fray killing the process, and those want opposite fixes.
//
// The probe spawns the REAL daemon entry the REAL way — `stdio: "ignore"`, config in
// FRAY_CLAUDE_BROKER — so the stack really does go nowhere, and asserts an attributed record lands
// anyway. Run it with the handlers removed and the log does not even exist (verified 2026-08-02).
