// A Claude thread can fall BEHIND its own model family. Frizz dispatches on the family alias (`opus`) and
// the pinned runtime resolves it, so when a pin bump moves the alias (Claude Code 2.1.280 took `opus` from
// Opus 5 to Opus 5.5) every worker started after the bump runs the new edition — and every worker started
// before it keeps the old one, because a daemon keeps the `claude` binary it was forked with for as long as
// it lives. Nothing about the thread's row changes: it says `opus` before and after.
//
// Two ways across, both the same act — retire the daemon, so the next turn cold-resumes the transcript in a
// process forked from the CURRENT pin (the permission-change and hibernation mechanism; see the bridge's
// retireDaemon):
//
//  - the operator's one-click upgrade in the composer's model picker (router `upgradeThreadModel`);
//  - on its own, at the first message after the thread's next COMPACTION (maintainer 2026-09-24: "we want
//    to always upgrade to the latest model version on compaction"). A model switch always re-reads the
//    whole context uncached — the prompt cache is per model — and a compaction is when that context is at
//    its smallest. The switch waits for the thread to be AT REST: a compaction usually lands mid-turn, and
//    retiring a process mid-turn kills the turn, its in-memory sub-agents and its shells. So it rides the
//    next input delivered to an idle thread, as a fresh process, never the turn that compacted.
