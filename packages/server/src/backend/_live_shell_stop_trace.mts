// LIVE PROBE: does a STOPPED background shell leave a durable trace on disk?
//   nub packages/server/src/backend/_live_shell_stop_trace.mts
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The × kills the process (backend/_live_shell_stop.mts) and the row leaves the board
// — but the row CAME BACK on the maintainer's real instance two days later, and reproducing it took one
// cold fold of their transcript: the kill writes NOTHING to the session JSONL, so the tailer's
// retirement is in-memory only and any re-prime (a fray restart, which is exactly what happened)
// resurrects the shell as live, forever, because its tool_use never gets a tool_result.
//
// Fixing that needs a signal the fold can read off DISK. There is a candidate: on the maintainer's
// session the killed task's `<taskId>.output` file was gone while 303 sibling output files remained.
// That is suggestive, not proof — a file could be missing because the task simply FINISHED, in which
// case "missing ⇒ stopped" would retire every completed shell's row for the wrong reason and, worse,
// would say nothing about a still-running one.
//
// So this probe measures the two cases side by side, which is the only way the inference is worth
// anything:
//
//   STOPPED   — launched, killed through the provider control. Does its output file disappear?
//   FINISHED  — launched, allowed to exit on its own. Does its output file SURVIVE?
//
// A "yes/yes" makes file-absence a sound kill signal. A "yes/no" (both vanish) makes it useless, and
// the fix has to be durable state instead.
