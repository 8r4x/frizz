// LIVE REPRO: does a background sub-agent's completion <task-notification> actually REACH the model?
//   nub packages/server/src/backend/_live_notify_delivery.mts [fleetSize] [replyChars]
//
// THE REPORT (2026-07-30, measured on the operator's own corpus): across two real threads, ~33% of
// `status=completed` sub-agent notifications were enqueued into Claude Code's queue and then removed
// WITHOUT ever materializing into the model's context — no user record, no `queued_command`
// attachment, nothing. 39/117 on one thread. Those were finished review reports (3k–24k chars of real
// verdicts) that the orchestrator never read, while frizz's timeline rendered no completion at all.
//
// Size was the obvious suspect and is NOT the mechanism: 3,318 chars was dropped while 12,299 was
// delivered. What the corpus DOES show is that drops arrive in BATCHES — several ids removed at one
// identical timestamp — which points at CONCURRENCY, not payload size. So this harness reproduces the
// real-world shape rather than a size sweep: a FLEET of background children finishing at roughly the
// same moment while the parent is deliberately held BUSY in the foreground, so every completion has to
// sit in the queue before it can be delivered.
//
// It prints the RAW per-notification ledger first. Read the dump; the PASS/FAIL lines are a summary.
//
// Classification, straight off the session JSONL (the same three carriers transcript.ts reads):
//   DELIVERED — the task-id appears in a `user` record or a `queued_command` attachment.
//   DROPPED   — the task-id appears ONLY in queue-operation records (enqueue/remove/dequeue).
