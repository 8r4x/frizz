// CI test for the broker bridge's UNQUEUE path — a real forked daemon over the fake claude CLI, no
// network and no credentials. It proves the parts that reading the code cannot:
//
//  1. the VERDICT survives the whole chain. A cancel crosses bridge → socket frame → daemon →
//     handle.cancelInput → the CLI's control channel, and comes back the other way through a
//     request/response pair bolted onto an otherwise fire-and-forget protocol. Every other frame in
//     that protocol is one-way, so nothing else in this repo exercises a reply at all — a correlation
//     bug would strand the caller until its deadline and read as a wedged session.
//  2. "not cancelled" is carried FAITHFULLY rather than being smoothed into a failure or a success.
//     The two answers have opposite meanings for the operator ("the agent will never read it" vs
//     "it is already on its way"), so a boolean lost anywhere in the chain is a lie either way.
//  3. the refusals hold: no live daemon, and a daemon too old to understand the frame.
