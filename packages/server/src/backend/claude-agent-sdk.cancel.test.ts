// THE CANARY for taking a queued message back.
//
// `cancelAsyncMessage` is real at runtime in @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk but absent from its
// `.d.ts` `Query` interface — so the compiler cannot see it, and an SDK bump that renamed or dropped
// it would typecheck clean, pass every other test, and only surface as a failed click in front of the
// operator. That is exactly the drift a canary is for.
//
// It costs nothing to run: `query()` constructs its Query and returns it BEFORE spawning the CLI, so
// this needs no `claude` binary, no credentials, no child process and no network. The bogus executable
// path is the proof — anything that actually launched would fail on it.
