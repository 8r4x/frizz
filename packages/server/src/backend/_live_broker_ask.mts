// LIVE end-to-end proof of NATIVE AskUserQuestion on the Claude broker path, against real claude:
//   nub packages/server/src/backend/_live_broker_ask.mts
//
// A unit test cannot prove this. The whole risk lives in ONE contract that only the real claude binary
// enforces: the answers object must be keyed by the FULL QUESTION TEXT, and the value must be exactly
// an advertised option label. Get either wrong and everything still "works" — the decision validates,
// the tool call completes — while claude's own result mapper quietly tells the model "The user did not
// answer the questions." and it asks again. So the assertion here is not "we sent an answer": it is
// that the MODEL, in its own next words, repeats the option the operator picked.
//
// Proves, against a real session driven through the real bridge + a real InteractionStore:
//   1. AskUserQuestion reaches canUseTool at all (the cc-worker PreToolUse deny hook stands down when
//      FRAY_NATIVE_ASK=1, which the bridge stamps whenever a store is wired)
//   2. it is journaled as an `agent-question` interaction — NOT "Approve AskUserQuestion?" — with one
//      select/multi-select field per question, carrying the real options
//   3. resolving with `answer` returns {questions, answers} and the model RECEIVES the chosen labels
//   4. a multiSelect question round-trips as the ", "-joined labels claude's schema documents
//   5. declining denies with a reason, and the session stays alive and answers afterwards
