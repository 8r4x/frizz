// LIVE end-to-end gate for the worker ENVIRONMENT contract (worker-env.ts): a REAL dispatched broker
// worker inherits the operator's environment and is denied only frizz's own control plane. Run:
//   nub packages/server/src/backend/_live_broker_env_inherit.mts
//
// WHY A LIVE PROBE: worker-env.test.ts pins what inheritWorkerEnvironment RETURNS, which is the easy
// half. The half that only a real dispatch can show is that the value survives every gate between frizz
// and the running claude process — the broker's `env:`, the daemon fork, buildEnvironment inside the
// daemon, and the SDK's own spawn. Until 2026-08-02 buildEnvironment THREW on any key outside its
// allowlist, and the failure mode was invisible from a unit test: the daemon died during startup before
// publishing its record, so the operator saw only every dispatch timing out "did not become ready".
// This probe is what would notice that regression coming back.
//
// The two assertions are deliberately opposed, so a filter that is too tight AND one that is too loose
// both fail here:
//   · an ordinary operator variable (a toolchain path, a proxy) MUST arrive
//   · FRIZZ_* MUST NOT — a worker dispatched to work on frizz would otherwise read the broker's daemon
//     payload and the launch identity, and the cc-worker hooks would see the SERVER's thread id
