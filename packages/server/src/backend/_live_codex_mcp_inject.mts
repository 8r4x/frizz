// LIVE PROBE: how does fray mount an MCP server into a CODEX worker?
//   nub packages/server/src/backend/_live_codex_mcp_inject.mts
//
// Why this exists. `FRAY_MCP` is mounted only by `claudeMcpConfig` (dispatch.ts), so the codex dispatch
// config carries no `mcp_servers` at all — while workerPrompt.ts claims fray "injects the ONE unified
// `fray` MCP server into BOTH claude and codex workers" and WORKER_PROMPT.codex.golden.txt documents
// `mcp__fray__spawn_thread` to codex workers. Codex workers were told about a tool they did not have.
//
// MEASURED 2026-07-31 against codex-cli 0.146.0, three findings:
//
//   1. A `mcp_servers` entry in the `thread/start` CONFIG BAG does NOT mount anything. Driven through
//      the real CodexAppServerBridge, the model answered the literal word `NOTOOL` — its own report
//      that no such tool was in its registry. This is the same shape as the hooks trap recorded in
//      dispatch.ts: the config bag carries `bypass_hook_trust`/`hooks` fine, but MCP servers are
//      process-level, not per-conversation, so a per-thread override has nothing to attach to.
//
//   2. A `-c mcp_servers.<name>={...}` override on the app-server's OWN ARGV DOES mount a callable
//      tool. That is the channel this probe exercises, and the fix it justifies.
//
//   3. Under a restrictive approval policy with no approval channel the mounted call is CANCELLED,
//      not missing: the log reads `mcp: <server>/<tool> started` then `(failed)` +
//      `user cancelled MCP tool call`. Do not read that as a mounting failure — it is the approval
//      path, which fray already owns separately (see "a worker NEVER stalls on an approval").
//
// The load-bearing evidence is the MARKER FILE, not the model's prose: the probe MCP server writes a
// nonce to disk when its tool actually executes, so a model that merely CLAIMS to have called the tool
// cannot produce a pass.
//
// This probe drives `codex exec`, not the app-server bridge, deliberately: both resolve `-c` through
// the same config loader, and the bridge arm needs a live app-server per arm, which made the probe
// take >5min and hang on unrelated environment contention. A hanging probe is a bad regression
// artifact. The app-server path is covered end-to-end by a real fray dispatch instead.
//
// INSTRUMENT NOTE, because getting here cost two wrong turns.
//
//   - `codex exec` BLOCKS on an open stdin ("Reading additional input from stdin...") and never runs
//     the prompt. That surfaces as a bare timeout which reads exactly like the tool being absent.
//     Hence `stdio: ["ignore", ...]` in runCodex below — do not "simplify" it back to execFile.
//   - An earlier revision blamed its null reads on looking the rollout up by `codexSessionId` rather
//     than `codexThreadId`. That was WRONG; _live_codex_rollout_id.mts settles it — on a fresh
//     dispatch the two ids are IDENTICAL and either finds the file. The actual cause was that those
//     bridge-driven turns HUNG (150s, never cleared, so no agent_message was ever written). The retry
//     changed the id lookup AND the turn-wait together, so the pass credited the wrong fix. One
//     variable at a time: a confirming result from a confounded control is worse than no result.
