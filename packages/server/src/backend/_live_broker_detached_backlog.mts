// LIVE proof of the property a concurrent session's plan note (fe4bdf3) claimed frizz does NOT have:
//   nub packages/server/src/backend/_live_broker_detached_backlog.mts
//
// That note says "the daemon does not buffer: claude-agent-broker.ts:81 drops every event when no
// client is attached, and there is no backlog or replay cursor," and concludes item 1 must not be
// attempted without a resume-from-sequence handshake first. The line it cites is the DIAGNOSTIC
// relay, which really did drop when detached (fixed by claude-broker-diagnostics.ts — the daemon now
// writes its own). The EVENT path a few lines above has always had a 20,000-frame backlog
// (claude-agent-broker.ts emitEvent) that is replayed in full on the next connect.
//
// Source-reading is not proof of behavior, so this drives it: attach, start a turn, DISCONNECT while
// it is still running, let the turn finish with nothing attached, then reconnect and check that the
// events emitted during the detached window arrive.
