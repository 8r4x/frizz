// THE TWO BACKENDS CARRY IT IN DIFFERENT PLACES, and asserting otherwise is what broke this test.
// `c4e6b767` condensed the Claude contract and, as its body says, took "the project-declared-monitor
// prescription and the frizz:waits pointer" out of it — the `waits` skill had been deleted in
// `0b2fd7ed`, and the guidance still reaches a Claude worker through the `gh` skill asserted below,
// which is loaded on demand rather than paid for on every turn. The goldens are current, not stale:
// dispatch.test.ts compares both byte-for-byte against their sources and is green. So the Claude
// contract is pinned on the rules it DOES still carry; do not "restore" the codex wording to it.
