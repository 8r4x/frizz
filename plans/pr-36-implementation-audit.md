# PR #36 — light-mode implementation audit

Verified September 19, 2026, on `4251a718`. This supersedes the visual-change recommendation in [the original review](pr-36-review.md). The maintainer approved the third mockup's light-gray outline treatment.

## What changed

- Light surfaces use a neutral scale: `#f7f7f7` canvas, white questions, `#dcdcdc` question outlines, and neutral prompt/message fills. Blue `#416896` is reserved for actions and selection; semantic warnings, errors, GitHub states and syntax colors remain distinct.
- Rounded buttons have subtle inset outlines. Menu rows and invisible hit areas do not acquire boxes. Composer buttons have 8px between their visible edges; the profile caret sits on the sans cap band.
- Light shadows are attenuated centrally, rather than carrying dark-mode-strength black shadows. Existing dark shadow strengths and palette values are retained.
- Mono is no longer a preference. Application typography is sans, including first paint and a stale saved Mono choice. Code, terminal output and literal technical fields retain their own monospace formatting.
- Appearance is browser-local: System, Light or Dark. It remains usable while server settings are unavailable. The existing project-sidebar, notification and dispatch settings remain independent.

The implementation retains the PR's semantic-token approach instead of adding per-component theme conditionals. [Theme ownership](../packages/web/src/lib/theme.ts), [palette tokens](../packages/web/src/theme.css), [first paint](../packages/web/index.html), and [standalone recovery](../packages/server/src/supervisor-pages.ts) agree. Changes to palette adapters preserve mounted terminals and interactive visualizations; Mermaid jobs serialize their global renderer configuration.

## Visible-surface coverage

The source audit covered all 89 production TSX component files, their shared style helpers, global CSS, and standalone recovery HTML. Browser coverage spans every major visible family below, not every possible combination of provider response, content and interaction state.

| Surface family | Browser coverage |
| --- | --- |
| Navigation and projects | Real project grid, rename/error/delete controls, project rail, desktop queue/running/snoozed/done bands, phone navigation, status list and toast |
| Threads | Real standalone transcript, stacked thread sheet, titles, header actions, lifecycle footer, activity rail and expanded tool output |
| Questions and cards | Real question selection and mobile reply; component fixtures for completion, awaiting, timer, PR/issue watches, single/multi/danger questions, refusals, pending asks, approval and provider errors |
| Composers | Real new-thread/reply controls; first-run fixture, model/effort picker, permission controls, attachment/GitHub/send buttons |
| Settings | Real appearance selection, persistence, server-setting failure, project-sidebar toggle, contextual Claude/Codex controls; quota and Goal fixtures |
| GitHub | Real picker/hovercard components with deterministic issue/PR/label responses, selection and prompt settings; no GitHub mutation |
| Readers | Real code/diff/Mermaid/interactive visualization; production file/Markdown/background-shell/sub-agent panels with fixture responses |
| Authentication and recovery | Real login terminal over one WebSocket; sign-in/error/restart component states; promoted artifact recovery after its disposable child is killed and assets removed |
| Shared primitives | Dialog, sheet, menu, popover, select, switch, tooltip, button/header styles, text/link/image wrappers and status marks exercised through their owning surfaces |

Direct source review also covers wrapper-only paths such as `ThreadDrawer`, `DrawerStack`, link wrappers and timestamp formatting. Their shared readers and primitives are rendered above; this audit does not claim a separate screenshot of every wrapper or a live provider session for each fixture.

## Verification

| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `nub run typecheck` | Passed |
| `nub run test` | 4,766 tests: 4,670 passed, 96 skipped, no failures |
| CI's board parser / portable monitor / sync checks | 73 board tests and 16 monitor tests passed; portable copies match |
| Contextual settings browser tests | 11 passed across agent settings, GitHub prompt and settings autosave |
| `verify-light-mode.mjs` | 61 passing checks against an isolated real Frizz stack |
| `verify-light-mode-gallery.mjs` | 176 component captures at 1100px/390px, light/dark; no document overflow or unexpected console/page errors |
| `verify-light-mode-artifact.mjs` | Promoted production UI, complete compiled token set, asset-independent recovery, anonymous refusal and OS/persisted appearance passed |

The real-stack run deliberately induces two project-rename refusals and asserts their HTTP 500 responses; those are expected console entries, not ignored failures. The gallery and promoted recovery have no unexpected errors. All owned Chrome instances, servers and disposable artifact processes were closed.

Visible enabled light text sampled by the harness meets 4.5:1. This is not a blanket accessibility certification: subtle decorative outlines intentionally have lower contrast, and disabled controls are excluded. Recovery's interactive boundary measures 3.54:1. The probes settle finite transitions and measure the actual gradient stops of animated text, not its transparent CSS `color`.

Optical measurements: composer edge gaps are **8px / 8px** in both palettes at device scale 8; the profile caret's cap-band residual is **−0.228px** at both widths in both palettes. Enlarged captures were inspected as well as measured. Selected screenshots in the gallery were reviewed for wrapping, clipping, alignment, border weight and inconsistent fills.

## Findings resolved during verification

- Permission-approval cards still used a blue wash; they now share the neutral question treatment.
- GitHub picker labels used arbitrary external hues directly as text; they now share the hovercard's readable theme-aware label helper.
- Outlined composer buttons needed edge-based spacing; the old bare-icon compensation produced inconsistent gaps.
- Dark-only modal shadows and one white-only GitHub hover treatment survived the first token pass; both now use theme tokens.
- A full-suite run exposed a race in the supervisor test's foreign-progress fixture: it briefly published the child's genuine PID before replacing it. The fixture now writes only the foreign PID; the strict assertion and production behavior are unchanged.

No PR was opened, pushed, reviewed or closed through GitHub during implementation. No npm release, production restart, provider approval or live provider dispatch was performed.
