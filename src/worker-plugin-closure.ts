// The worker-plugin closure: the files a `runtime/` tree MUST carry for a dispatched worker to be
// whole, and the assertion that says so loudly at build time.
//
// It lives in its own module because TWO build paths stage that tree and both must hold the same
// opinion about it: `artifacts.ts` (the frizz-dev promoted artifact, `~/.frizz/builds/<digest>/runtime`)
// and `scripts/prepare-package.mjs` (the published package, `<pkg>/runtime`). Each used to keep its own
// hand-copy of the list, so widening the closure meant editing both — and the two were only ever in
// agreement between the first edit and the second. Widening it used to mean typing the same string
// into the artifact builder, the pack script and four test fixtures, and a worker whose plugin lacks
// a file degrades in SILENCE, which is precisely the failure this assertion exists to prevent.
//
// Narrowing it is the same hazard pointed the other way: a file the list still names but the tree no
// longer holds fails NOTHING until `prepack` runs, so the break surfaces at the release. Reverting
// the Stop hook left `stop-fence.mjs` and `transcript-usage.mjs` here after both were deleted, and
// the tree could not be packed until this list caught up. When a listed file goes, it goes here too.
//
// `scripts/*.mjs` imports this .ts directly, as publish-manifest.mjs already does with its own half.

// The worker contract used to ship as markdown under runtime/prompts/ and get read at dispatch time;
// it is now compiled into the server bundle (workerPrompt.ts), so a promoted artifact carries no
// prompt closure. Old artifacts that still list prompts/ files remain valid (extra runtimeFiles are
// harmless); nothing reads them.
