//
//   nub scripts/check-runtime-pins.mjs            a human-readable verdict
//   nub scripts/check-runtime-pins.mjs --json     the same thing for a script to read
//
// Frizz pins ONE Claude Code and ONE Codex (packages/server/src/runtimes.ts) and provisions that exact
// binary from the vendor's own npm package. A stale pin is not a conservative one — it is a broken
// worker: the first provisioned Claude Code refused the default model outright because a model's
// minimum CLI is enforced server-side, and the 0.146 Codex pin could never offer gpt-6-astra because
// the catalogue server omits a model from clients below its `minimal_client_version`. So the pin has
// to be WATCHED, and this is the instrument that watches it.
//
// It reads the pins from the source of truth rather than a copy, asks the registry what the vendors
// have published, and — the part that is easy to forget — checks that the PLATFORM packages for that
// latest version are actually published too. The version tag and the per-platform tarballs do not
// land at the same instant, and provisioning fetches the platform package: bumping to a version whose
// tarball is not there yet breaks every machine that boots before it appears.
//
// THE AGE FLOOR NO LONGER GATES A BUMP, and the reason is arithmetic rather than appetite. `nub`
// refuses any version under 24 hours old (`minimumReleaseAge=1440`, its own default), and this check
// used to treat that as an eligibility test: behind, but hold until the release is a day old. On a
// dependency you did not choose today that is exactly right. On these two it never converges —
// Anthropic shipped 0.3.263 through 0.3.267 in two days, so every candidate was superseded BEFORE it
// cleared the floor, and the pin was not one day behind but permanently behind (maintainer, 2026-09-09:
// "I think we should ship these things as quickly as possible").
//
// It bought no safety the bump procedure does not already provide, either. Every pin move is verified
// against the real binary — the wire contract against the app-server's own generated schema, and the
// transcript format by folding a real session through the production parser — which is a stronger check
// on a first-party runtime than waiting to see whether anyone else complains first.
//
// So the age is REPORTED and never blocks. The gate stays on for the rest of the tree; the install a
// runtime bump performs passes `--minimum-release-age-exclude "@anthropic-ai/*"` to step around it for
// these packages only. Codex was never gated at all — Frizz's own provisioner fetches it, not the
// package manager.
//
// EXIT CODES, so a caller can branch without parsing prose:
//   0   both pins are current
//   10  at least one pin is behind (`behind` in the JSON says which; `eligible` says which may move now)
//   1   the check itself failed (network, registry, a shape that moved)
