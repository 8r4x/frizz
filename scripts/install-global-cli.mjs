// `--no-env-file` disables nub's automatic `.env*` discovery for the launcher process only. nub
// resolves those files from the CWD's project root, so launching a board from any repo carrying an
// ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in its .env put that key in the frizz server env — and from there into every
// detached worker daemon it forks, each of which outlives the shell, where Claude Code blocks on
// "Detected a custom API key". v4 fixed this with `env -u` and was
// reverted (3f311e9) for being too invasive: it also stripped a key the developer had deliberately
// exported. This is the narrower cut — it drops only what nub read off DISK. A key exported in the
// shell still reaches the worker, so letting an API key supersede the subscription stays available.
//
// The batch translation of that one line, clause by clause, because none of it is guessable:
//   · `rem #` keeps the ownership MARKER byte-identical across platforms — `#` is not a comment in
//     batch, `rem` is, and the marker is matched as a substring.
//   · `setlocal` is `env VAR=…`: the variable exists for the child and dies with the shim, instead
//     of leaking into the calling console for the rest of its life.
//   · a batch file WAITS rather than exec-replacing, so the exit code has to be forwarded by hand.
//     `exit /b %ERRORLEVEL%` reads the value at the moment the line is parsed, which is after the
//     launcher returned; without it every failed launch reports success.
//   · CRLF, deliberately: cmd.exe's parser is documented against CRLF and mis-handles LF-only files
//     in ways that depend on the command (a split `goto`, a swallowed final line).
