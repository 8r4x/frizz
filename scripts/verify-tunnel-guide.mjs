/**
 * The tunnel guide, driven end to end over the real internet.
 *
 * `docs/cloudflare-tunnel` makes three claims about the Frizz side that no unit test can settle: that a
 * board behind a tunnel accepts requests arriving as the public origin, that it REFUSES them without a
 * redeemed access code, and that scanning the link it prints turns a phone into a signed-in visitor.
 * Every one of those depends on headers a real Cloudflare edge sets and a loopback probe does not.
 *
 * A QUICK TUNNEL (`cloudflared tunnel --url`) rather than a named one, deliberately: it needs no zone,
 * no DNS record and no account, so this can run on any machine without touching anyone's
 * infrastructure. The named-tunnel commands in the guide are verified separately against
 * `cloudflared --help`; what is under test here is Frizz's behaviour behind a real edge.
 *
 * KNOWN EXTERNAL FAILURE, and read it before blaming this repo: on 2026-08-25 every quick tunnel from
 * this machine answered 404 for EVERY origin, including a trivial server that returns 200 to any path.
 * Both curl and fetch saw it, so the 404 comes from Cloudflare's edge and not from the board.
 * TryCloudflare is rate-limited and carries no uptime guarantee — it is documented as unreliable. If
 * this harness reports the tunnel never answering, prove the edge with a two-line origin server before
 * looking at Frizz, or point TUNNEL_GUIDE_HOSTNAME at a named tunnel on a zone you control.
 *
 * Runs the BUILT artifact, not the source, because that is what `npx frizz` gives a reader of the guide.
