// Does a SCHEDULED recurring prompt actually reach a worker that is MID-TURN?
//
// The scheduler unit tests pin the delivery GATE with a stubbed `resume`. They cannot answer the only
// question that matters for this feature: whether the real broker will take a message addressed at a
// `claude` that is busy, and whether the agent then reads it without the turn having to end first.
// That is a seam between three processes (fray → broker daemon → the CLI's own command queue), so it
// gets driven for real here.
//
// Run against a stack booted with --wakers and a real HOME (the broker needs the keychain):
//   nub scripts/adhoc-stack.mjs --port=4931 --home=$HOME --project=/tmp/rp-probe-repo --wakers &
//   nub scripts/verify-recurring-prompt-midturn.mjs 4931
//
// PASS requires all of:
//   1. a delivery happens while the thread's turn is in flight, not at a rest;
//   2. the worker READS it before the turn that was running has ended;
//   3. the cadence keeps running — a second one arrives an interval later, still mid-turn.
