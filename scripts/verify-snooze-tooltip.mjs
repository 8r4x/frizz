// THE SNOOZE IS TOOLTIP-ONLY ON THE RAIL. No sidebar row may spend a subtitle line on a park
// ("SNOOZED · Today at 5:00 PM" / "BUMPS · …", removed 2026-08-03), and hovering the row's INDICATOR
// must be enough to read when the thread wakes — on a Held row (the hourglass, which has said so for a
// while) AND on the rows a park does not quiet: one whose own turn is running, and one still waiting on
// a sub-agent it dispatched. Those two keep their live spinner and gain the park as a second tooltip
// line, which is the whole point of the change: the row says what the thread is DOING, the tooltip says
// when it goes away.
//
// Run against held-rows-fixture.html on a plain Vite dev server (fixtures are NOT servable through the
// frizz stack — its Vite runs in middleware mode and falls back to index.html for every unknown path):

//   nub scripts/verify-snooze-tooltip.mjs --url=http://localhost:5418/held-rows-fixture.html
