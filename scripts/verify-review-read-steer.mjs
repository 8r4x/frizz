// REAL-SUBSYSTEM VERIFICATION that a pr-watch wake for a REVIEW hands the worker a command that
// actually returns the review's substance.
//
// No stubbed GitHub anywhere. This drives the REAL scheduler with the REAL GraphQL fetcher (the
// maintainer's own `gh` token, real HTTPS) against a REAL public PR, takes the steer the scheduler
// composes, EXTRACTS the `gh` command out of it, RUNS that exact command, and checks the bytes that
// come back are the review's inline comments. Steer → command → content, end to end.
//
//   node scripts/verify-review-read-steer.mjs
//
// The defect it exists for (2026-07-31, nubjs/nub#587): a review app files a review whose `body` is
// EMPTY and whose substance is N inline comments. The wake's permalink lands on the review anchor, so
// the obvious read — `gh api …/pulls/N/reviews/ID` — hands back `body: ""`. A woken worker spent FOUR
// calls getting to the content: the body, the body again in full, a `…/pulls/N/comments` sweep filtered
// by `pull_request_review_id` that silently hit the 100-item default page, and finally the same sweep
// with `--paginate`. It never reached `…/pulls/N/reviews/ID/comments`, which answers it in ONE call.
//
// Requires `gh auth status` to be green. Exits nonzero on any failed assertion.
