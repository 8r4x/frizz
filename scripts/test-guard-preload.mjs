// Loaded with --import into every process node's test runner starts; see scripts/run-tests.mjs.
// Everything here runs in the per-file CHILD process (the parent leaves NODE_TEST_CONTEXT unset).
//
// Why this exists: under `--test-force-exit` the child calls process.exit() as soon as its tests
// finish, and process.exit() throws away whatever is still queued on an ASYNC pipe. The child's
// verdicts travel to the parent over exactly such a pipe, so the tail of a file's results is lost —
// the parent counts only what arrived, reports `fail 0` / `cancelled 0`, and exits 0. Measured here
// 2026-08-16: one run of four dropped the last 31 of delivery-ledger.test.ts's 70 tests and still
// looked green. Upstream is nodejs/node#64833, still open.
//
// Two jobs, belt and braces:
//
//  1. Put the report pipe in BLOCKING mode, so those writes complete before the process exits. This
//     is the same remedy as the upstream fix; we apply it from here because upstream has not landed.
//  2. Tally the verdicts this child EMITS and write that tally synchronously from an `exit` handler,
//     which survives the same process.exit() that truncates the pipe. run-tests.mjs reconciles the
//     tally against what the parent actually received, so a drop from any cause — this one or the
//     next one — fails the run loudly instead of passing quietly.
