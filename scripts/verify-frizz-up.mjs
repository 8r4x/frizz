/**
 * `frizz up` end-to-end, minus the Cloudflare edge.
 *
 * `up` is the one command the operator is told to run, and until this script it had never been driven
 * at all — every part of it was verified in isolation and the wiring between them was believed. The two
 * failure modes it exists to prevent are the two that actually happened on the live board:
 *
 *   - a board running WITHOUT `--public-origin`, so every tunnelled request is a 403 and restarting
 *     cloudflared alone changes nothing;
 *   - cloudflared outliving or predeceasing the board, which is the "Cloudflare error 1033" state.
 *
 * Everything here is loopback. `cloudflared` is replaced on PATH by a recorder that logs its argv and
 * then waits, because what `up` owns is the SPAWN and the LIFETIME, not the tunnel protocol — the real
 * named tunnel is exercised by cloudflared itself, and the edge's header contract is replayed by
 * scripts/verify-access-codes.mjs. Nothing is exposed to the internet and no Cloudflare state is touched.
