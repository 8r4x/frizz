// No stubbed GitHub. This drives the REAL scheduler with the REAL GraphQL fetcher (the maintainer's
// own `gh` token, real HTTPS to api.github.com) and a REAL SQLite storage + wake outbox, against a
// REAL public PR — nubjs/nub#587, the exact thread whose wake started this. Its comment history is
// the perfect fixture: TWO comments from the SAME author eight hours apart, which the old
// actor-only steer ("New GitHub comment … from @colinhacks") could not tell apart, so the woken
// worker re-read the thread and re-litigated the stale one.
//
//   node scripts/verify-pr-watch-steer.mjs
//
// Requires `gh auth status` to be green. Exits nonzero on any failed assertion.
