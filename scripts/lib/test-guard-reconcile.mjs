//
// Pure on purpose: run-tests.mjs does the file reading and the process handling, this decides
// whether a run proved anything. Every problem it returns is a reason the run must NOT be green.

// `emitted` — what each test file tallied for itself, from scripts/test-guard-preload.mjs.
// `received` — what reached the parent's reporter, from scripts/test-guard-reporter.mjs.
// `runnerSaidGreen` gates the checks that ask whether the run was VERIFIABLE at all: when the runner
// has already failed, the run is red anyway and a second complaint about missing bookkeeping would
// only bury the real failure.
