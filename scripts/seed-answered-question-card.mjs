// Seed a disposable adhoc stack with ONE simulated worker whose transcript is the shape that made the
// queue card repaint itself: the human's ask, a whole iteration, the answer to a REGISTERED question,
// then a second whole iteration.
//
// The answer is the point. It is the one user turn frizz DELIVERS that the HUMAN wrote — it arrives as a
// scheduler wake (the human may have answered while the worker's process was down), so a card that reads
// `wake` as "frizz wrote this" walks straight past it, back to the ask, and paints both iterations
// (maintainer 2026-08-31: "the cue card should only go back to the most recent user interaction"). The
// card must open on the ANSWER, with everything above it left to the drawer.
//
// The delivered text is composed by the SAME shared formatter the scheduler uses and carries the real
// wake-delivery token and clock note, so this exercises the production projection rather than a
// hand-written string — the clock note in particular is why the rule has to read `displayText`.
//
// Follows the frizz-stack recipe: a session row + a JSONL the REAL tailer reads. No process: liveness
// comes from the row.
