/**
 * A relayed terminal against the REAL access gate.
 *
 * `verify-relay-e2e.mjs` proves the frames reach a socket server. It cannot prove the thing that
 * matters most about a terminal on the public internet: that Frizz's own gate stands in front of it.
 * Its board is a toy that accepts every upgrade, so a relay forwarding NO identity at all passes there
 * and fails against the real thing — in whichever direction is worse.
 *
 * So this puts the real `RestartSupervisorProxy` in the path, with a public origin declared, and asks
 * it the only two questions worth asking: is an unauthenticated terminal REFUSED, and does a visitor
 * holding a redeemed session get through? No relay and no workerd — the seam under test is the board's
 * authority boundary, and adding a runtime either side of it would only make a failure harder to read.
