// The detached daemon exists for exactly ONE reason: an in-flight Codex turn must SURVIVE the fray
// runtime being recycled (Update & Restart). Before it, a restart SIGTERMed the app-server and every
// running turn died mid-sentence — no task_complete, no turn_aborted, no resume; the thread just went
// quiet until a human poked it (that is the "agents shutting down and pausing" complaint).
//
// _live_appserver_daemon_survival.mts proves this from SOURCE. That is not enough: the daemon was
// BROKEN IN THE PROMOTED ARTIFACT for its entire existence (the sibling-.ts entry the bundle never
// emitted), so the survival property has never once held for a real user. This proves it where it
// actually has to hold — a built artifact, killed hard, restarted.
//
// Isolation: temp HOME + state dir + project dir, unique port and tmux socket, wakers/reaper off.
// CODEX_HOME points at the real ~/.codex so the app-server can authenticate.
